Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:04,226
we are down to the final
two championship words.

3
00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:09,731
One or both of our spellers will walk away
with the first-place trophy.

4
00:00:09,815 --> 00:00:11,316
Dylan, you're up.

5
00:00:18,406 --> 00:00:19,741
"Logorrhea."

6
00:00:19,825 --> 00:00:22,410
May I have the definition, please?

7
00:00:22,494 --> 00:00:27,123
Logorrhea is excessive and often
incoherent talkativeness.

8
00:00:33,713 --> 00:00:35,340
"Logorrhea."

13
00:00:54,276 --> 00:00:56,111
"Logorrhea"?

14
00:00:56,194 --> 00:00:57,654
Congratulations, Dylan.

15
00:00:57,737 --> 00:01:00,574
You've won the Scripps
National Spelling Bee.

16
00:01:00,657 --> 00:01:04,286
Yes! Yes!

17
00:01:08,623 --> 00:01:09,875
Go get 'em.

18
00:01:15,171 --> 00:01:16,923
Ladies and gentlemen,

19
00:01:17,007 --> 00:01:19,217
please be seated for Akeelah's turn.

00:01:25,557 --> 00:01:27,225
"Pulchritude."

22
00:01:28,393 --> 00:01:30,437
"Pulchritude."

23
00:01:36,026 --> 00:01:39,321
It's derived from
the Latin word <i>pulcher,</i>

24
00:01:39,404 --> 00:01:42,240
meaning "beautiful",

25
00:01:42,324 --> 00:01:44,701
- isn't it?
- That's correct.

Congratulations, Akeelah.

34
00:02:05,597 --> 00:02:06,932
That's what I'm talking about!

35
00:02:10,644 --> 00:02:12,145
<i>You know that feeling</i>

36
00:02:12,228 --> 00:02:13,521
<i>where everything feels right,</i>

37
00:02:13,605 --> 00:02:17,817
<i>where you don't have to worry
about tomorrow or yesterday,</i>

38
00:02:17,901 --> 00:02:20,445
<i>but you feel safe</i>

39
00:02:20,528 --> 00:02:22,948
<i>and know you're doing
the best you can?</i>

40
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:25,075
<i>There's a word for that feeling.</i>

41
00:02:25,158 --> 00:02:27,327
<i>It's called love.</i>

00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,830
<i>L-O-V-E.</i>

43
00:02:30,914 --> 00:02:33,583
<i>And it's what I feel for all my family</i>

44
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:37,170
<i>and all my coaches
in my neighborhood</i>

45
00:02:37,253 --> 00:02:38,880
<i>where I come from,</i>

46
00:02:38,964 --> 00:02:42,467
<i>where I learned how to spell.</i>
