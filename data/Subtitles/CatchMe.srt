My son, the birdman.

5
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:13,229
Some uniform, Frank.

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,231
What do you think?

7
00:00:15,232 --> 00:00:16,898
Nice.

8

So, Dad... Daddy, have you
gotten the postcards?

11
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,073
Of course.

12
00:00:25,074 --> 00:00:27,376
This fork is ice cold.

13
00:00:27,377 --> 00:00:31,046
No, no, Dad, th-that's
a chilled salad fork.

Open it.

20
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:53,035
You know what those are, right?

21
00:00:53,036 --> 00:00:55,037
Those are the keys

22

00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,052
Yeah. I'm giving you
a Cadillac.

28
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:11,821
Dad, sh-she's parked
downstairs.

why don't you, you know,
drive on over to Mom's house

31
00:01:16,292 --> 00:01:18,460
pick her up,
take a little joyride?

32
00:01:18,461 --> 00:01:20,262
Do you know what would happen

33
00:01:20,263 --> 00:01:21,564
if the IRS found out

34
00:01:21,565 --> 00:01:25,067
I was driving around
in a new coupe?

I took the train here, Frank.

36
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,739
I'm taking the train home.

37
00:01:31,408 --> 00:01:33,442
All right.

38
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:41,551
I have plenty of money.

39

You know, if you
ever, ever need anything...

40
00:01:43,954 --> 00:01:45,287
You worried?

41
00:01:45,288 --> 00:01:47,823
About me?

42
00:01:47,824 --> 00:01:49,458
No, I'm not...
I'm not worried.

43
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:51,895
You think I can't
buy my own car?

44
00:01:51,896 --> 00:01:56,465
Two mice fell in a
bucket of cream, Frank.

45
00:01:56,466 --> 00:01:58,333
Which one am I?

46
00:01:58,334 --> 00:02:01,203
You're that second mouse.

I went by the store today.

48
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:08,444
I had to close the
store for awhile.

49
00:02:08,445 --> 00:02:10,012
It's all about timing, Frank.

50
00:02:10,013 --> 00:02:11,614
The goddamn government
knows that.

51
00:02:11,615 --> 00:02:13,215
They hit you when you're down.

52

I wasn't going to let them

53
00:02:14,585 --> 00:02:16,151
take it from me, so I just...

54
00:02:16,152 --> 00:02:19,255
shut the doors myself,
called their bluff.

55
00:02:23,827 --> 00:02:25,995
Sooner or later,
they'll forget about me.

Have you told Ma?

58
00:02:33,503 --> 00:02:38,040
She's so stubborn, your mother.

59
00:02:40,677 --> 00:02:42,011
Don't worry.

60
00:02:42,012 --> 00:02:44,379
I'm not going to let her go
without a fight.

Since the day we... we met.

65
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,659
Daddy, out of all those men

66
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:00,129
you were the one that
took her home, remember that.

that tiny social hall

68

69
00:03:08,038 --> 00:03:10,539
What was the name of that town?

70
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,874
Montrichard, Dad.

71
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,375
Yeah.

72
00:03:13,376 --> 00:03:16,211
I didn't speak a word of French

73
00:03:16,212 --> 00:03:19,682
and six weeks later,
she was my wi...

74
00:03:19,683 --> 00:03:22,685
She's your wife.

75
00:03:22,686 --> 00:03:26,956
My son bought me
a Cadillac today.

76
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:30,993

It's not what you think.

I'm just a copilot.

over their shoulders

86
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,823
wondering where
you're going tonight.

87
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,291
Where you going, Frank?

88
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:05,995
Dad, nobody's staring at me.

89
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,364
Some place exotic?

90
