1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,980
You know what sucks?

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,420
Realizing that everything you believe in
is complete and utter bullshit.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,511
- It sucks.
- What do you mean?

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,580
Uh, you know, destiny,
and soul mates, and true love,

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,310
and all that childhood
fairy tale nonsense.

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,715
You were right.
I-I should have listened to you.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,640
No.

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,310
Yeah. What?
What are you smiling at?

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,954
- Tom.
- What?

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,380
What are you looking at me
like that for?

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,100
Well, you know,

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,380
I guess it's 'cause...

13
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,020
I was sitting in a deli
and reading Dorian Gray

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,580
and... a guy comes up to me...

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,260
and asked me about it,

16
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,352
and... now he's my husband.

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,660
Yeah. And... so?

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,620
So, what if I'd gone to the movies?

19
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:06,620
What if I had gone
somewhere else for lunch?

20
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,030
What if I'd gotten there
10 minutes later?

21
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,620
It was-

22
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,029
It was meant to be.

23
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,799
And I just kept thinking,

24
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,540
- Tom was right.
- No.

25
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,700
Yeah, I did.

26
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,314
[Laughs]
I did.

27
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,520
It just wasn't me
that you were right about.

28
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,020
I should go.

29
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,112
But I'm really happy to see
that you're doing well.
