1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,429
We ain't talking about baseball!

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,896
We talking about you going off
and laying up with another woman,

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,976
then bringing it home to me.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,336
That's what we're talking about.
We're not talkin' about no baseball!

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,616
Rose, you're not listening to me.

6
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,518
I'm trying to explain it to you
the best way I know how.

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,354
It's not easy for me to admit

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,552
that I've been standing
in the same place for 18 years!

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,154
Well, I've been standing with you!

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,279
I've been right here with you, Troy!
I got a life, too.

11
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,592
I gave 18 years of my life
to stand in the same spot as you!

12
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,636
Don't you think
I ever wanted other things?

13
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,836
Don't you think
I had dreams and hopes?

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,514
What about my life? What about me?

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,200
Don't you think it ever crossed my mind
to want to know other men?

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,592
That I wanted to lay up somewhere
and forget about my responsibilities?

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,272
That I wanted someone
to make me laugh,

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,396
so I could feel good?

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,550
You're not the only one
who's got wants and needs.

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,591
But I held on to you, Troy.

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,832
I took all my feelings,
my wants and needs and dreams,

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,717
and I buried them inside you.

23
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,075
I planted a seed
and watched and prayed over it.

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,152
I planted myself inside you
and waited to bloom!

25
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,074
And it didn't take me no 18 years
to realize the soil was hard and rocky,

26
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,276
and it wasn't never gonna bloom!

27
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,272
But I held on to you, Troy.
I held you tighter.

28
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,351
You was my husband.

29
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,079
I owed you everything I had.

30
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,833
Every part of me I could find to give you.

31
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,748
And upstairs in that bedroom,
with the darkness falling in on me,

32
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,953
I gave everything I had
to try and erase the doubt

33
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,713
that you wasn't the finest man
in the world.

34
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,473
And wherever you was going,
I was gonna be there with you,

35
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,034
because you was my husband.

36
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,472
'Cause that's the only way
I was gonna survive as your wife.

37
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,395
You always talking about what you give
and what you don't have to give.

38
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,798
But you take, too, Troy.

39
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,519
You take
and don't even know nobody's giving.

40
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,656
You say I take and don't give.

41
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,829
Troy, you're hurting me.

42
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,176
- Troy, you're hurting my arm, let go!
- I gave you everything I got.

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,256
Don't you tell that lie on me.

44
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,679
- Mama!
- Don't you tell that lie!

45
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,273
Troy, you're hurting me!

46
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,233
Troy! Troy!

47
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,315
All right. That's strike two.

48
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,358
You stay away from around me, boy.
Don't you strike out.

49
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,031
You're living with a full count.
