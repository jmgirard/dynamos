1
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:06,355
You died on a Saturday morning.

2
00:00:08,066 --> 00:00:11,819
And I had you placed
here under our tree.

3
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:21,537
And I had that house of your father's
bulldozed to the ground.

4
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:27,335
Mama

5
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:33,424
always said that dying was a part of life.

6
00:00:36,845 --> 00:00:39,180
I sure wish it wasn't.

7
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,603
Little Forrest is doing just fine.

8
00:00:46,938 --> 00:00:48,022
But...

9
00:00:48,273 --> 00:00:50,941
About to start school again soon,

10
00:00:52,778 --> 00:00:56,571
and I make his breakfast, lunch
and dinner every day.

11
00:00:58,741 --> 00:01:04,746
I make sure he combs his hair
and brushes his teeth every day.

12
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:10,460
Teaching him how to play Ping-Pong.

13
00:01:11,754 --> 00:01:12,796
Okay.

14
00:01:13,047 --> 00:01:14,214
He's really good.

15
00:01:14,298 --> 00:01:16,424
Forrest, you go.

16
00:01:20,638 --> 00:01:22,222
We fish a lot.

17
00:01:25,768 --> 00:01:29,229
(SOBBING) And every night, we read
a book. He's so smart, Jenny.

18
00:01:32,483 --> 00:01:34,734
You'd be so proud of him.

19
00:01:36,445 --> 00:01:37,904
I am.

20
00:01:38,948 --> 00:01:42,158
He wrote you a letter.

21
00:01:43,744 --> 00:01:45,787
And he says I can't read it.

22
00:01:45,913 --> 00:01:49,457
I'm not supposed to,
so I'll just leave it here for you.

23
00:02:05,516 --> 00:02:06,850
Jenny,

24
00:02:12,648 --> 00:02:15,859
I don't know if Mama was right,

25
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:18,695
or if it's Lieutenant Dan.

26
00:02:18,821 --> 00:02:21,406
I don't know

27
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:25,994
if we each have a destiny,

28
00:02:28,038 --> 00:02:33,168
or if we're all just floating around
accidental-like on a breeze.

29
00:02:37,673 --> 00:02:39,507
But I think

30
00:02:41,385 --> 00:02:43,178
maybe it's both.

31
00:02:47,516 --> 00:02:50,393
Maybe both is happening
at the same time.

32
00:02:56,525 --> 00:02:58,526
But I miss you, Jenny.

33
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:09,329
If there's anything you need,
I won't be far away.
