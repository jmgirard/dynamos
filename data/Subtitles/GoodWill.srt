1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,260
Hey, you know you'd be better off shoving that cigarette
up your ass. It'd probably be healthier for you.

2
00:00:02,398 --> 00:00:06,525
- Yeah, I know. It really gets in the way of my yoga.
- You work out, huh?

3
00:00:06,652 --> 00:00:09,356
- What, you lift?
- Yeah.

4
00:00:09,487 --> 00:00:11,480
- Uh, Nautilus?
- No, free weights.

5
00:00:11,614 --> 00:00:13,191
- Oh, really? - Yeah.
- Free weights, huh?

6
00:00:13,324 --> 00:00:15,115
- Yeah, big time. -
Yeah? - Just like that.

7
00:00:15,242 --> 00:00:17,531
- What do you bench?
- 285. What do you bench?

8
00:00:19,954 --> 00:00:22,030
You paint that?

9
00:00:22,165 --> 00:00:25,580
Yeah. You paint? Do you sculpt?

10
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:27,536
- No.
- Do you like art?

11
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,039
Do you like music?

12
00:00:32,173 --> 00:00:34,212
This is a real piece of shit.

13
00:00:34,342 --> 00:00:36,215
Oh. Well, tell me
what you really think.

14
00:00:36,343 --> 00:00:39,676
Uh, just, uh, the linear
and impressionistic mix...

15
00:00:39,805 --> 00:00:42,046
makes a very muddled composition.

16
00:00:42,182 --> 00:00:45,965
It's also a Winslow Homer rip-off, except
you got whitey, uh, rowin' the boat there.

17
00:00:46,102 --> 00:00:47,975
Well, it's art, Monet.
It wasn't very good.

18
00:00:48,103 --> 00:00:50,724
- That's not really what concerns me though.
- What concerns you?

19
00:00:50,856 --> 00:00:53,263
- Just the colouring.
- You know what the real bitch of it is?

20
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,392
It's paint-by-number.

21
00:00:55,526 --> 00:00:57,981
Is it colour-by-number? Because
the colours are fascinating to me.

22
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,689
- Aren't they, really? What about that?
- You bet.

23
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:02,739
I think you're about one step away
from cuttin' your fuckin' ear off.

24
00:01:02,866 --> 00:01:04,941
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

25
00:01:05,076 --> 00:01:08,824
Think I should move to the south
of France, change my name to Vincent?

26
00:01:08,954 --> 00:01:10,781
You ever heard the sayin',
"any port in a storm"?

27
00:01:10,914 --> 00:01:13,831
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Maybe that means you.

28
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:15,334
In what way?

29
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,745
- Uh, maybe you're in the middle of a storm, a big fuckin' storm.
- Yeah, maybe.

30
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,880
The sky's fallin' on your head. The
waves are crashin' over your little boat.

31
00:01:22,007 --> 00:01:24,213
The oars are about to snap.

32
00:01:24,342 --> 00:01:26,002
You just piss in you pants.
You're cryin' for the harbour.

33
00:01:26,135 --> 00:01:28,424
So maybe you do
what you gotta do to get out.

34
00:01:28,554 --> 00:01:30,879
You know, maybe you became
a psychologist.

35
00:01:31,014 --> 00:01:34,597
Bingo. That's it. Let me do my job now.
You start with me. Come on.

36
00:01:36,978 --> 00:01:40,726
- Maybe you married the wrong woman.
- Maybe you should watch your mouth!

37
00:01:42,482 --> 00:01:44,807
Watch it right there, chief,
all right?

38
00:01:47,403 --> 00:01:49,277
Ah.

39
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,531
Mmm, that's it, isn't it?

40
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,902
You married the wrong woman.

41
00:01:59,455 --> 00:02:03,784
What happened?
What, did she leave you?

42
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:06,206
Was she, you know,
banging some other guy?

43
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:11,711
If you ever disrespect my wife again,
I will end you.

44
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:13,880
I will fuckin' end you.

45
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,800
Got that, chief?

46
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,802
- Time's up.
- Yeah.
