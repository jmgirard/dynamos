MARJORIE:
Does it hurt yet? I hope it does.

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,362
I hope it hurts like hell.

3
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:18,368
John Coffey, you've been condemned to
die in the chair by a jury of your peers.

4
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:22,163
Sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

5
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:25,708
Do you have anything to say
before sentence is carried out?

6
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,962
I'm sorry for what I am.

7
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:43,726
Please, boss...

8
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:47,814
...don't put that thing over my face.

9
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,317
Don't put me in the dark.

10
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:54,487
I's afraid of the dark.

11
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,832
All right, John.

12
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:29,021
[SOFTLY]
Heaven, I'm in heaven

13
00:01:29,231 --> 00:01:32,024
Heaven, heaven

14
00:01:32,276 --> 00:01:34,110
I'm in heaven

15
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:37,280
Heaven, heaven

16
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,240
I'm in heaven

17
00:02:00,137 --> 00:02:01,762
John Coffey...

18
00:02:02,764 --> 00:02:05,892
...electricity shall pass through
your body until you are dead...

19
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,269
...in accordance with state law.

20
00:02:10,647 --> 00:02:14,400
May God have mercy on your soul.

21
00:02:48,727 --> 00:02:49,936
Paul.

22
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,024
You have to say it.

23
00:02:56,693 --> 00:02:58,945
You have to give the order.

24
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:19,298
COFFEY'S VOICE:
He killed them with they love.

25
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:24,345
That's how it is every day
all over the world.

26
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,569
Roll on two.

00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,739
