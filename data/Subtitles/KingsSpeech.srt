1
00:00:03,413 --> 00:00:05,666
- Mr. Wood.
- Good luck, Your Majesty.

2
00:00:08,961 --> 00:00:10,087
Mr. Wood.

3
00:00:11,046 --> 00:00:14,550
- You've redecorated, Logue.
- I made it cozy.

4
00:00:16,301 --> 00:00:19,555
- Some fresh air.
- There you are, darling.

5
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:25,895
I'm a thistle-sifter.

6
00:00:25,978 --> 00:00:29,073
I've a sieve of sifted thistles
and a sieve of unsifted thistles.

7
00:00:29,147 --> 00:00:32,777
A sieve of sifted thistles
and a sieve of unsifted thistles.

8
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:34,987
- Because I'm...
- Bertie. Darling.

9
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,198
Make sure it's not switched on.

10
00:00:37,281 --> 00:00:39,158
Remember, the red light
will blink four times,

11
00:00:39,241 --> 00:00:40,993
then I've asked them to turn it off.

12
00:00:41,076 --> 00:00:44,125
'Cause we don't want that evil eye
staring at you all the way through.

13
00:00:45,664 --> 00:00:47,507
One minute, sir.

14
00:00:49,543 --> 00:00:51,671
I'm sure you'll be splendid.

15
00:01:03,682 --> 00:01:05,275
Forty seconds, sir.

16
00:01:08,186 --> 00:01:09,779
Logue.

17
00:01:10,606 --> 00:01:12,859
However this turns out...

18
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:17,659
...I don't know how to thank you...
for what you've done.

19
00:01:20,532 --> 00:01:22,125
Knighthood?

20
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,253
Twenty seconds.

21
00:01:34,087 --> 00:01:38,308
Forget everything else,
and just say it to me.

22
00:01:39,551 --> 00:01:42,350
Say it to me as a friend.

23
00:02:23,804 --> 00:02:25,932
In this grave...

24
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:28,896
..hour..

25
00:02:34,815 --> 00:02:40,788
...perhaps the most fateful
in our history...

26
00:02:43,115 --> 00:02:45,493
...I send...

27
00:02:45,575 --> 00:02:48,124
...to every household of my...

28
00:02:50,914 --> 00:02:52,757
...a-peoples...

29
00:02:55,335 --> 00:02:57,212
...both at home...

30
00:03:01,383 --> 00:03:03,431
...and overseas...

31
00:03:12,936 --> 00:03:14,984
...this message...

32
00:03:15,981 --> 00:03:20,703
...spoken with the same
depth of feeling...

33
00:03:21,486 --> 00:03:23,488
...for each one of you...

34
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:29,086
...as if I were able
to cross your threshold

35
00:03:29,161 --> 00:03:33,382
and speak to you... myself.

36
00:03:37,002 --> 00:03:41,803
For the second time
in the lives of most of us...

37
00:03:41,882 --> 00:03:44,431
...we are... at...

38
00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:45,852
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

39
00:03:45,927 --> 00:03:47,179
...at war.

40
00:03:48,138 --> 00:03:49,606
Very good.

41
00:03:51,183 --> 00:03:55,438
Over and over again...

42
00:03:56,521 --> 00:03:59,900
...we have tried to find...

43
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:07,708
...a peaceful way out
of the differences...

44
00:04:08,742 --> 00:04:11,370
...between ourselves...

45
00:04:11,453 --> 00:04:13,000
...and those...

46
00:04:13,705 --> 00:04:19,053
...who are now our... enemies.

47
00:04:21,046 --> 00:04:25,051
But it has been... in vain.

48
00:04:25,884 --> 00:04:30,936
We have been forced into a conflict,

49
00:04:31,014 --> 00:04:35,941
for we are called
to meet the challenge of a principle,

50
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:40,240
which, if it were to prevail,

51
00:04:40,315 --> 00:04:44,866
would be fatal to any civilized order

52
00:04:44,945 --> 00:04:46,993
in the world.

53
00:04:47,906 --> 00:04:50,580
Such a principle,

54
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:56,587
stripped of all disguise,

55
00:04:56,665 --> 00:04:59,794
is surely the mere...

56
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:06,892
...primitive doctrine that might...

57
00:05:08,426 --> 00:05:10,019
...is right.

58
00:05:10,971 --> 00:05:16,819
For the sake of all
that we ourselves hold dean

59
00:05:16,893 --> 00:05:20,488
it is unthinkable

60
00:05:20,564 --> 00:05:25,240
that we should refuse to meet...

61
00:05:25,318 --> 00:05:26,991
...the challenge.

62
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:34,287
It is to this high purpose

63
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:37,043
that I now call

64
00:05:37,122 --> 00:05:41,093
my people at home,

65
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:45,673
and my peoples across the seas,

66
00:05:45,755 --> 00:05:50,511
who will make our cause their own.

67
00:05:50,594 --> 00:05:55,600
I ask them to stand calm

68
00:05:55,682 --> 00:05:58,856
and firm and united

69
00:05:58,935 --> 00:06:02,985
in this time of trial.

70
00:06:03,064 --> 00:06:05,817
The task will be hard.

71
00:06:06,776 --> 00:06:10,747
There may be dark days ahead,

72
00:06:10,822 --> 00:06:16,670
and war can no longer be confined

73
00:06:16,745 --> 00:06:19,043
to the battlefield.

74
00:06:19,122 --> 00:06:22,126
But we can only do the right

75
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,802
as we see the right,

76
00:06:24,878 --> 00:06:28,849
and reverently commit

77
00:06:28,924 --> 00:06:33,395
our cause to God.

78
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,938
If one and all we keep

79
00:06:39,017 --> 00:06:43,944
resolutely faithful to it,

80
00:06:44,022 --> 00:06:49,950
then, with God's help,

81
00:06:50,028 --> 00:06:53,908
we shall... prevail.
