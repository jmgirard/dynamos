00:01:02,325 --> 00:01:04,242
Excuse me. What day is it?

3
00:01:04,244 --> 00:01:06,159
Sunday.

4
00:01:06,161 --> 00:01:07,244
Thank you.

00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:20,609
[Larry] Hi. You've reached
the McPherson family.

12
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:22,444
Please leave a message.
Thank you.

13
00:02:22,446 --> 00:02:23,947
[beeps]

14
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:25,075
Hi, Mom and Dad.

15
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,911
It's me. Christine.

16
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:33,165
It's the name you gave me.
It's a good one.

17
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:37,754
Dad, this is more for Mom.

18
00:02:40,923 --> 00:02:42,551
Hey, Mom.

19
00:02:45,178 --> 00:02:51,724
Did you feel emotional the first
time that you drove in Sacramento?

20
00:02:51,726 --> 00:02:55,519
I did, and I wanted to tell you,

21
00:02:55,521 --> 00:02:58,440
but we weren't really talking
when it happened.

22
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,860
All those bends I've
known my whole life,

23
00:03:02,862 --> 00:03:08,241
and stores and the whole thing.

24
00:03:08,243 --> 00:03:14,581
[Marion's indistinct voice]

25
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,960
[Marion's indistinct voice
continues]

26
00:03:27,387 --> 00:03:28,972
But I wanted to tell you...

27
00:03:31,432 --> 00:03:33,100
I love you. [sighs]

28
00:03:34,436 --> 00:03:37,105
Thank you. I'm...

29
00:03:40,066 --> 00:03:41,067
Thank you.

30
00:03:46,408 --> 00:03:51,408
...
