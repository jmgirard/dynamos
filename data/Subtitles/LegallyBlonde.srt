1
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,909
- Excuse you. You're in my way.
- She's a student. She can't defend you.

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:13,668
Massachusetts Supreme
Judicial Court Ruling 3.03.

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,981
See?

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,700
- Thank you, David.
- Counselors, approach the bench.

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,827
- You're not going up there.
- Oh, yes, I am.

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,824
I'm sorry. Maybe you
didn't hear me. You're fired.

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,627
Counselors, now! All of you.

8
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,585
Elle Woods, Your Honor.

9
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,426
Rule 3.03 of Supreme Judicial Court
states that a law student

10
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,981
may appear on behalf
of a defendant in criminal proceedings

11
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,507
Your Honor,
I have no problem with this.

12
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,982
- I do. I'm not allowing it.
- But you agreed last night.

13
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,347
In your office,
when we were discussing my career?

14
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,945
The ruling also states that you need
a licensed attorney to supervise you.

15
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,149
- Mr. Callahan?
- That I won't agree to.

16
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,667
I'll supervise, Your Honor.

17
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,180
Well, then, Ms. Woods, proceed.

18
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,304
Thank you, Your Honor.

19
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,909
(chuckling)

20
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,391
- Hi.
- Hi.

21
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,831
Enjoy prison.

22
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,780
Mrs. Windham,
you do realize what you're doing?

23
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,271
Absolutely.

24
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:37,622
- Oh, my God. There she is. Elle!
- Elle, we came to see your trial.

25
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,627
Oh, look, how cute! There's, like,
a judge and everything. And jury people.

26
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,311
- Vote for Elle!
- Ladies, take a seat.

27
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,388
Go, girl.

28
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,623
Do you swear to tell the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

29
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,464
- I do.
- Be seated.

30
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,901
Ms. Woods, you may
begin your questioning.

31
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,591
First of all, I would like
to point out that,

32
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,623
not only is there
no proof in this case,

33
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:17,030
but there's a complete
lack of mens rea,

34
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,901
which, by definition,
tells us that there can be no crime

35
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,267
without a... vicious will.

36
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,025
I am aware of the meaning of mens rea.

37
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,662
What I'm unaware of is why
you're giving me a vocabulary lesson

38
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,266
when you should be
questioning your witness.

39
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,030
Yes, Your Honor.

40
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,666
Ms. Windham...

41
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,508
When you arrived back at the house...

42
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,066
...was your father there?

43
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,862
Not that I saw. But like I said,

44
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,227
I went straight upstairs
to take a shower.

45
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,903
And... when you came downstairs,
what happened?

46
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,543
I saw Brooke standing over his body...

47
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,142
...drenched in his blood.

48
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,422
- But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
- No, she'd stashed it by then.

49
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,389
Move to strike that
from the record, Your Honor.

50
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,542
- It's speculation.
- So stricken.

51
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,341
Go ahead.

52
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,510
Ms. Windham, did you hear a shot fired?

53
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,983
No. I was in the shower.

54
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,461
OK.

55
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,227
So... sometime in the 20 minutes

56
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,064
that you were in the shower...

57
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,061
...your father was shot?

58
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,901
I guess.

59
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,030
Your father was shot
while you were in the shower...

60
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,783
...but you didn't
hear the shot because...

61
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,543
...because you were in the shower?

62
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,580
Yes. I was washing my hair.

63
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,510
- (barks)

64
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:10,346
- Where is she going with this?
- Have a little faith, Gerard.

65
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,666
Ms. Windham,
what had you done earlier that day?

66
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,106
I got up, got a latte,

67
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,389
went to the gym,
got a perm and came home.

68
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,987
Where you got in the shower?

69
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,864
I believe the witness has made it
clear that she was "in the shower."

70
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,307
(all chuckling)

71
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,789
Yes, Your Honor.

72
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,547
Ms. Windham,
had you ever gotten a perm before?

73
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,950
- Yes.
- How many, would you say?

74
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,301
Two a year since I was 12.

75
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,511
You do the math.

76
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,509
You know, a girl in my sorority,
Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once.

77
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,909
We all tried to talk her out of it.
Curls weren't a good look for her.

78
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,030
She didn't have your bone structure.

79
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,181
Aww.

80
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,661
But thankfully, that same day,

81
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,822
she entered the Beta Delta Pi
wet T-shirt contest,

82
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,823
where she was completely
hosed down from head to toe.

83
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,950
Objection! Why is this relevant?

84
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,229
- I have a point. I promise.
- Then make it.

85
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,670
Yes, ma'am.

86
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,106
Chutney, why were Tracy Marcinko's
curls ruined when she got hosed down?

87
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,749
- Because they got wet.
- Exactly.

88
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,511
Because isn't it the first cardinal
rule of perm maintenance

89
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,867
that you're forbidden
to wet your hair for at least 24 hours

90
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,988
after getting a perm
at the risk of deactivating

91
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:45,270
-the ammonium thioglycolate?
- Yes...

92
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,549
And wouldn't somebody who's had,
say 30 perms before in their life

93
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,702
be well aware of this rule?

94
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,750
And if you weren't washing your hair,
as I suspect you weren't,

95
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,109
because your curls are still intact,
wouldn't you have heard the gunshot?

96
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,911
And if, in fact, you had heard the
gunshot, Brooke Windham

97
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,064
wouldn't have had time to hide
the gun before you got downstairs,

98
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,945
which would mean that you would've
had to have found Mrs. Windham

99
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,622
with a gun in her hand to make
your story plausible. Isn't that right?

100
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,147
She's my age, did she tell you that?

101
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,621
How would you feel if your father
married someone your age?

102
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,306
You, however, had time to hide the gun,
didn't you, Chutney?

103
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,940
- After you shot your father.
- I didn't mean to shoot him!

104
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,307
I thought it was you
walking through the door!

105
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,428
(crowd exclaiming)

106
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,982
Order! Order! Order.

107
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,941
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

108
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,909
Oh, my God.

109
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,788
Bailiff, take the witness into custody,

110
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,069
where she will be charged
for the murder of Heyworth Windham.

111
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,506
In the matter of
The State v. Brooke Windham,

112
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,344
this case is dismissed.

113
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,582
Mrs. Windham, you are free to go.

114
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,741
Yes!

115
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,471
(all cheering)
