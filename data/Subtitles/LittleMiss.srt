1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,395
Why did you want to kill yourself?

2
00:00:02,495 --> 00:00:04,994
<i>No, don't answer the question, Frank.</i>

3
00:00:05,104 --> 00:00:07,534
<i>- Richard! Richard!
- He's not gonna answer the question. Frank.</i>

4
00:00:07,634 --> 00:00:10,074
- I wanted to kill myself-
- Don't listen to him.

5
00:00:10,174 --> 00:00:12,304
<i>- I was very unhappy.
- He's sick in his head.</i>

6
00:00:12,404 --> 00:00:14,804
- Richard!
- I'm sorry! I don't think it's an appropriate conversation...

7
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:17,074
- for a seven-year-old.
- She's gonna find out anyway.

8
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:21,084
- Okay.
- Go on, Frank.

9
00:00:24,284 --> 00:00:26,514
Why were you unhappy?

10
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:30,084
Um, well, there are a lot of reasons.

11
00:00:30,194 --> 00:00:35,103
Mainly, though, I fell in love
with someone who didn't love me back.

12
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:36,763
Who?

13
00:00:36,873 --> 00:00:40,103
<i>One of my grad students.
I was very much in love with him.</i>

14
00:00:40,213 --> 00:00:42,583
Him?

15
00:00:42,683 --> 00:00:47,013
<i>It was a boy?
You fell in love with a boy?</i>

16
00:00:47,123 --> 00:00:50,243
- Yes, I did. Very much so.
- That's silly.

17
00:00:50,353 --> 00:00:53,053
<i>You're right. It was silly.
It was very, very silly.</i>

18
00:00:53,163 --> 00:00:56,223
- There's another word for it.
- Dad.

19
00:00:56,333 --> 00:01:00,233
<i>- So, that's when you tried to kill yourself?
- Well, no.</i>

20
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:03,892
The boy that I was in love with fell in love
with another man- Larry Sugarman.

21
00:01:04,002 --> 00:01:06,262
- Who's Larry Sugarman?
- Larry Sugarman is, perhaps...

22
00:01:06,372 --> 00:01:09,532
the second most highly regarded
Proust scholar in the U.S.

23
00:01:09,642 --> 00:01:13,202
- Who's number one?
- That would be me, Rich.

24
00:01:13,312 --> 00:01:15,712
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

25
00:01:15,812 --> 00:01:17,942
So that's when.

26
00:01:18,052 --> 00:01:20,412
No. What happened was
I was a bit upset...

27
00:01:20,522 --> 00:01:22,812
so I said some things
that I shouldn't have said...

28
00:01:22,922 --> 00:01:25,052
<i>and I did some things
that I shouldn't have done...</i>

29
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:27,212
and subsequently
I was fired from my job...

30
00:01:27,322 --> 00:01:30,491
<i>and forced to move out of my apartment
and move into a motel.</i>

31
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,751
<i>- And that's when you tried to-
- Well, no.</i>

32
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:39,061
Actually, all of that was okay.

33
00:01:39,171 --> 00:01:43,761
What happened was two days ago the
MacArthur Foundation, in its infinite wisdom...

34
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:48,071
<i>awarded a genius grant
to Larry Sugarman.</i>

35
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:50,441
And that's when I-

36
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:53,141
<i>Decided to check out early.</i>

37
00:01:53,251 --> 00:01:56,811
Yes. Yes. And I failed
at that as well.

38
00:01:56,921 --> 00:02:00,910
<i>Olive, the important thing
to understand here...</i>

39
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,250
<i>is that Uncle Frank
gave up on himself.</i>

40
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,290
He made a series of foolish choices-
I'm sorry- and he gave up on himself...

41
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,960
which is something winners never do.
