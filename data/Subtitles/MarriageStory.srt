1
00:00:00,296 --> 00:00:02,340
You're being so much like your father.

2
00:00:02,841 --> 00:00:04,258
Do not compare me to my father!

3
00:00:04,342 --> 00:00:06,760
I didn't compare you to him.
I said you were acting like him.

4
00:00:06,845 --> 00:00:08,096
You're exactly like your mother.

5
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:11,307
Everything you were complaining about her,
you're doing. You're suffocating Henry.

6
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,102
First of all, I love my mother.
She was a wonderful mother.

7
00:00:14,185 --> 00:00:16,520
- I'm just repeating what you told me.
- Secondly, how dare you

8
00:00:16,604 --> 00:00:18,439
compare my mothering to my mother!

9
00:00:18,522 --> 00:00:21,484
I may be like my father,
but I am not like my mother!

10
00:00:21,567 --> 00:00:22,568
You are!

11
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:24,195
And you're like my father!

12
00:00:24,278 --> 00:00:25,696
You're also like my mother!

13
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,991
You're all the bad things
about all of these people!

14
00:00:28,491 --> 00:00:29,575
But mostly your mother.

15
00:00:29,658 --> 00:00:30,993
When we would lie in bed together,

16
00:00:31,077 --> 00:00:33,913
sometimes I would look at you and see her
and just feel so gross!

17
00:00:33,997 --> 00:00:36,708
- I felt repulsed when you touched me!
- You're a slob.

18
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,418
I made all the beds,
closed all cabinets...

19
00:00:38,501 --> 00:00:41,795
The thought of having sex with you
makes me want toÂ peel my skin off.

20
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,215
You'll never be happy, in LA or anywhere.

21
00:00:44,298 --> 00:00:46,800
You'll think you found
some better opposite guy than me,

22
00:00:46,885 --> 00:00:49,262
and in a few years,
you'll rebel against him

23
00:00:49,345 --> 00:00:52,473
because you need to have your voice,
but you don't want a voice.

24
00:00:52,556 --> 00:00:54,850
You just want to fucking complain
about not having a voice!

25
00:00:54,934 --> 00:00:58,187
I think about being married to you,
and that woman is a stranger to me.

26
00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:01,189
- I mean, we had a child's marriage.
- You've regressed.

27
00:01:01,274 --> 00:01:03,902
You've gone back to your life
before you met me, it's pathetic.

28
00:01:03,985 --> 00:01:07,864
People used to tell me that you were
too selfish to be a great artist.

29
00:01:07,947 --> 00:01:09,658
And I used to defend you.

30
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,116
They were absolutely right.

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,912
All your best acting is behind you.
You're back to being a hack!

32
00:01:13,995 --> 00:01:17,165
You gaslighted me!
You're a fucking villain!

33
00:01:17,248 --> 00:01:20,709
You want to present yourself as a victim
because it's a good legal strategy?

34
00:01:20,793 --> 00:01:23,879
Fine, but you and I both know
you chose this life!

35
00:01:24,422 --> 00:01:26,299
You wanted it until you didn't!

36
00:01:27,341 --> 00:01:29,593
You used me so you could get out of LA.

37
00:01:29,677 --> 00:01:30,719
I didn't use you.

38
00:01:30,803 --> 00:01:33,138
You did, and then you blamed me for it!

39
00:01:33,306 --> 00:01:35,724
You always made me aware
of what I was doing wrong,

40
00:01:35,808 --> 00:01:37,100
how I was falling short!

41
00:01:37,185 --> 00:01:38,895
Life with you was joyless!

42
00:01:38,978 --> 00:01:41,523
What, so then you had to go
and fuck someone else?

43
00:01:41,605 --> 00:01:43,191
You shouldn't be upset that I fucked her!

44
00:01:43,274 --> 00:01:45,151
You should be upset
that I had a laugh with her!

45
00:01:45,234 --> 00:01:46,069
Do you love her?

46
00:01:46,152 --> 00:01:47,403
No.

47
00:01:47,486 --> 00:01:49,947
But she didn't hate me. You hated me.

48
00:01:50,031 --> 00:01:51,115
You hated me.

49
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:52,909
You fucked somebody we worked with.

50
00:01:52,992 --> 00:01:55,494
You stopped having sex with me
in the last year.

51
00:01:55,578 --> 00:01:57,079
I never cheated on you.

52
00:01:57,163 --> 00:01:58,247
That was cheating on me!

53
00:01:58,331 --> 00:02:00,291
But there was so much I could have done.

54
00:02:00,374 --> 00:02:03,002
I was a director in my twenties
who came from nothing

55
00:02:03,086 --> 00:02:06,255
and was suddenly on the cover
of fucking <i>Time Out New York!</i>

56
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:09,300
I was hot shit and I wanted
to fuck everybody and I didn't.

57
00:02:09,383 --> 00:02:11,635
And I loved you
and I didn't want to lose you.

58
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:14,555
But I'm in my twenties,
and I didn't want to lose that too,

59
00:02:14,638 --> 00:02:16,182
and I kinda did!

60
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,017
And you wanted so much so fast.

61
00:02:19,102 --> 00:02:20,812
I didn't even want to get married.

62
00:02:20,895 --> 00:02:22,481
And fuck it!

63
00:02:22,813 --> 00:02:24,523
There's so much I didn't do.

64
00:02:24,607 --> 00:02:27,276
- Thanks for that!
- You're welcome!

65
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,529
I can't believe
I have to know you forever!

66
00:02:30,613 --> 00:02:32,698
You're fucking insane!

67
00:02:33,491 --> 00:02:35,701
And you're fucking winning!

68
00:02:36,327 --> 00:02:37,912
Are you kidding me?

69
00:02:38,287 --> 00:02:40,123
I wanted to be married.

70
00:02:40,664 --> 00:02:41,999
I'd already lost!

71
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,793
You didn't love me as much as I loved you!

72
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,339
What does that have to do with LA?

73
00:02:50,674 --> 00:02:51,509
What?

74
00:02:51,592 --> 00:02:55,012
You're so merged
with your own selfishness,

75
00:02:55,096 --> 00:02:58,224
you don't even identify it
as selfishness anymore!

76
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,851
You're such a dick!

77
00:03:00,935 --> 00:03:03,563
Every day I wake up
and I hope you're dead!

78
00:03:03,646 --> 00:03:06,690
Dead, like if I could guarantee
Henry would be okay,

79
00:03:06,774 --> 00:03:10,611
I'd hope you'd get an illness,
and then get hit by a car and die!

80
00:03:30,381 --> 00:03:32,425
Oh, God!

81
00:03:42,393 --> 00:03:43,227
I'm sorry.

82
00:03:45,146 --> 00:03:46,105
Me too.
