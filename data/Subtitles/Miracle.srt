1
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,395
Great moments...

2
00:02:04,064 --> 00:02:06,982
...are born from great opportunity.

3
00:02:09,152 --> 00:02:11,654
That's what you have here tonight, boys.

4
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,618
That's what you've earned here tonight.

5
00:02:21,915 --> 00:02:23,290
One game.

6
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:29,004
If we played them ten times,
they might win nine.

7
00:02:30,882 --> 00:02:32,883
But not this game.

8
00:02:34,302 --> 00:02:35,970
Not tonight.

9
00:02:38,723 --> 00:02:41,809
Tonight we skate with them.

10
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,105
Tonight we stay with them.

11
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:49,859
And we shut them down because we can.

12
00:02:55,824 --> 00:03:01,412
Tonight we are
the greatest hockey team in the world.

13
00:03:08,128 --> 00:03:11,005
You were born to be hockey players.

14
00:03:12,007 --> 00:03:14,008
Every one of you.

15
00:03:16,761 --> 00:03:20,389
And you were meant to be here tonight.

16
00:03:24,978 --> 00:03:27,146
This is your time.

17
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:34,445
Their time is done.

18
00:03:34,529 --> 00:03:36,530
It's over.

19
00:03:37,574 --> 00:03:43,579
I'm sick and tired of hearing about what
a great hockey team the Soviets have.

20
00:03:43,663 --> 00:03:47,541
Screw them. This is your time.

21
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:52,463
Now, go out there and take it.

22
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,333
Hold up here a second.
We're just gonna wait for the OK.

23
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,505
- We're all set.
- All right. Go ahead and send them in.

24
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,799
OK. It's time.

25
00:05:18,842 --> 00:05:20,509
Come on, Jimmy.

26
00:05:20,594 --> 00:05:24,805
Come on, Buzzy. Let's hustle.

27
00:05:28,476 --> 00:05:30,519
Come on, Brotz. Let's go, Strobel.

28
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:34,857
Rizzo.

29
00:05:36,943 --> 00:05:41,113
USA! USA! USA!
