1
00:00:14,096 --> 00:00:15,348
Come on, man.

2
00:00:41,957 --> 00:00:43,209
Give me your head.

3
00:00:45,377 --> 00:00:48,881
Here, let your head
rest in my hand. Relax.

4
00:00:48,964 --> 00:00:52,434
I got you, I promise.
I'm not gon' let you go.

5
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,558
Hey, man, I got you.

6
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:57,607
There you go.
Ten seconds.

7
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,443
Feel that right there?

8
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,231
You're in the middle
of the world, man.

9
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,692
That's good.

10
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,446
Do like this.

11
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:17,577
Look at you.

12
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,207
More athletic.

13
00:01:19,286 --> 00:01:22,460
There you go...
there you go.

14
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,211
Yeah.
I think you ready.

15
00:01:27,461 --> 00:01:28,963
I think we got a swimmer.

16
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,012
You wanna try?
You ready to swim?

17
00:01:33,592 --> 00:01:34,844
Go.

18
00:01:39,306 --> 00:01:42,560
Yeah, man!

19
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,109
Yeah!

20
00:02:08,043 --> 00:02:09,761
<i>Let me tell you something, man.</i>

21
00:02:09,837 --> 00:02:11,805
<i>There are black people
everywhere.</i>

22
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,596
<i>Remember that, okay?</i>

23
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:17,654
<i>No place you can go in the world
ain't got no black people.</i>

24
00:02:17,678 --> 00:02:19,555
<i>We's the first on this planet.</i>

25
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:25,436
I been here a long time.

26
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,523
But I'm from Cuba.

27
00:02:30,107 --> 00:02:32,155
Lot a black folks in Cuba,

28
00:02:32,234 --> 00:02:34,074
you wouldn't know that
from being here, though.

29
00:02:35,237 --> 00:02:38,832
I was a wild li'l shorty, man,
just like you.

30
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:42,378
Runnin' around with no shoes on
when the moon was out.

31
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:45,873
This one time...

32
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:50,591
I run by this old...
this old lady.

33
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:54,765
I was runnin', hollerin'...
cuttin' a fool, boy.

34
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:58,932
This old lady, she stopped me.

35
00:02:59,011 --> 00:03:00,354
She said...

36
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,986
"Running around,
catching up all that light.

37
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:12,818
In moonlight...
black boys look blue.

38
00:03:14,401 --> 00:03:15,744
You blue.

39
00:03:17,988 --> 00:03:19,615
That's what I gon' call you.

40
00:03:21,116 --> 00:03:22,368
Blue."

41
00:03:25,412 --> 00:03:27,460
So your name Blue?

42
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,377
Nah.

43
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:40,936
At some point you gotta decide
for yourself who you gon' be.

44
00:03:43,597 --> 00:03:46,020
Can't let nobody make
that decision for you.
