1
00:00:08,846 --> 00:00:09,686
How much?

2
00:00:09,886 --> 00:00:11,366
Sixty-nine cents.

3
00:00:11,766 --> 00:00:12,966
And the gas.

4
00:00:13,846 --> 00:00:15,926
Y'all getting any rain up your way?

5
00:00:17,565 --> 00:00:18,565
What way would that be?

6
00:00:18,645 --> 00:00:20,285
I seen you was from Dallas.

7
00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:28,405
What business is it of yours
where I'm from, friendo?

8
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:32,565
I didn't mean nothing by it.

9
00:00:32,765 --> 00:00:34,085
Didn't mean nothing.

10
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:36,565
Just passing my time.

11
00:00:38,925 --> 00:00:42,205
If you don't wanna accept that I
don't know what else I can do for you.

12
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:46,805
Will there be something else?

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,165
I don't know. Will there?

14
00:00:55,364 --> 00:00:56,404
Is something wrong?

15
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:57,181
With what?

16
00:00:57,216 --> 00:00:57,924
With anything?

17
00:00:59,724 --> 00:01:00,964
Is that what you're asking me?

18
00:01:01,804 --> 00:01:03,524
Is there something wrong with anything?

19
00:01:04,404 --> 00:01:05,484
Will there be anything else?

20
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:06,564
You already asked me that.

21
00:01:10,844 --> 00:01:12,764
Well... I need to see about closing.

22
00:01:13,204 --> 00:01:14,444
See about closing.

23
00:01:14,564 --> 00:01:15,009
Yes sir.

24
00:01:15,044 --> 00:01:16,124
What time do you close?

25
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,361
Now. We close now.

26
00:01:17,396 --> 00:01:18,529
Now is not a time.

27
00:01:18,564 --> 00:01:19,764
What time do you close?

28
00:01:19,804 --> 00:01:21,524
Generally around dark. At dark.

29
00:01:26,564 --> 00:01:28,363
You don't know what you're
talking about, do you?

30
00:01:28,398 --> 00:01:28,963
Sir?

31
00:01:31,203 --> 00:01:33,963
I said you don't know
what you're talking about.

32
00:01:37,043 --> 00:01:38,243
What time do you go to bed?

33
00:01:38,923 --> 00:01:39,443
Sir?

34
00:01:39,643 --> 00:01:41,363
You're a bit deaf, aren't you?

35
00:01:41,398 --> 00:01:43,083
I said what time do you go to bed?

36
00:01:47,683 --> 00:01:49,083
Somewhere around 9:30.

37
00:01:49,683 --> 00:01:51,263
I'd say around 9:30.

38
00:01:51,298 --> 00:01:52,808
I could come back then.

39
00:01:52,843 --> 00:01:54,163
Why would you be coming back?

40
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:55,128
We'd be closed.

41
00:01:55,163 --> 00:01:56,163
Yeah. You said that.

42
00:01:58,523 --> 00:02:00,168
Well... I got to close now.

43
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,763
You live in that house out back?

44
00:02:03,043 --> 00:02:04,882
Yes I do.

45
00:02:05,762 --> 00:02:07,202
You lived here all your life?

46
00:02:08,722 --> 00:02:12,602
This is my wife's father's place. Originally.

47
00:02:15,442 --> 00:02:16,322
You married into it.

48
00:02:17,042 --> 00:02:19,682
We lived in Temple Texas for many years.

49
00:02:21,162 --> 00:02:22,602
Raised a family there.

50
00:02:23,402 --> 00:02:24,607
In Temple.

51
00:02:24,642 --> 00:02:26,762
We come out here about four years ago.

52
00:02:27,722 --> 00:02:28,602
You married into it.

53
00:02:29,402 --> 00:02:30,882
If that's the way you wanna put it.

54
00:02:31,162 --> 00:02:32,842
I don't have some way to put it.

55
00:02:33,962 --> 00:02:35,042
That's the way it is.

56
00:02:43,401 --> 00:02:45,801
What's the most you've
ever lost in a coin toss?

57
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:47,646
Sir?

58
00:02:47,681 --> 00:02:51,001
The most you ever lost in a coin toss.

59
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:54,761
I don't know. I couldn't say.

60
00:02:57,881 --> 00:02:58,721
Call it.

61
00:02:59,481 --> 00:02:59,961
Call it?

62
00:03:00,081 --> 00:03:00,601
Yes.

63
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:01,921
For what?

64
00:03:02,161 --> 00:03:02,961
Just call it.

65
00:03:06,081 --> 00:03:09,761
Well, we need to know what
we're calling it for here.

66
00:03:09,796 --> 00:03:10,801
You need to call it.

67
00:03:10,881 --> 00:03:12,561
I can't call it for you.

68
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:14,640
It wouldn't be fair.

69
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,320
I didn't put nothing up.

70
00:03:16,355 --> 00:03:17,600
Yes, you did.

71
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,920
You've been putting it up your whole life.

72
00:03:19,955 --> 00:03:21,000
You just didn't know it.

73
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,160
You know what date is on this coin?

74
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,400
No.

75
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,360
1958.

76
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,480
It's been traveling
twenty-two years to get here.

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,960
And now it's here.

78
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,320
And it's either heads or tails.

79
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,080
And you have to say. Call it.

80
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,440
Look... I need to know what I stand to win.

81
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,600
Everything.

82
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,445
How's that?

83
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,640
You stand to win everything. Call it.

84
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,559
Alright. Heads then.

85
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,239
Well done.

86
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,559
Don't put it in your pocket.

87
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:02,564
Sir?

88
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,639
Don't put it in your pocket.
It's your lucky quarter.

89
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,039
Where you want me to put it?

90
00:04:08,074 --> 00:04:09,159
Anywhere not in your pocket.

91
00:04:10,399 --> 00:04:13,479
Or it'll be mixed in with the
others and become just a coin.

92
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,519
Which it is.
