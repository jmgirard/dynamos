1
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:07,771
Thanks.

2
00:00:12,244 --> 00:00:14,861
Oh, gosh. It's him.

3
00:00:15,497 --> 00:00:16,863
Hey, Hal!

4
00:00:18,584 --> 00:00:20,120
Welcome home, kiddo.

5
00:00:25,007 --> 00:00:28,296
- Get into these arms, you little punk.
- Dad.

6
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:30,210
Finally.

7
00:00:36,435 --> 00:00:40,054
Oh, I hope you had a lousy time at that
camp because you are not going back.

8
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,846
I missed you too much.

9
00:00:43,484 --> 00:00:45,146
What happened to you, Hal?

10
00:00:45,778 --> 00:00:47,565
Something's changed.

11
00:00:48,572 --> 00:00:49,813
Are you getting taller?

12
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:54,242
So, what's up, Dad?

13
00:00:54,411 --> 00:00:56,573
I mean, how's Chessy and everybody?

14
00:00:56,747 --> 00:00:59,706
Great. Everybody's great.
Can't wait to see you.

15
00:01:00,334 --> 00:01:03,953
Eight weeks really is too long, Hal.
A lot's been happening around here.

16
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:06,371
A lot's happened to me too, Dad.

17
00:01:06,548 --> 00:01:09,791
I mean, I feel like
I'm practically a new woman.

18
00:01:11,637 --> 00:01:13,754
What's the matter? I cut myself shaving?

19
00:01:13,931 --> 00:01:18,175
No, it's just... just seeing you
for the first time.

20
00:01:18,352 --> 00:01:21,390
I mean, you know... in so long.

21
00:01:22,022 --> 00:01:24,355
You look taller to me too, Dad.

22
00:01:24,775 --> 00:01:26,437
Come on, squirt. Let's get home.

23
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:44,167
<i>Oh, by the way,
thanks for all those newsy letters.</i>

24
00:01:44,336 --> 00:01:47,044
I'm really glad I bought you
all that personalized stationery

25
00:01:47,214 --> 00:01:48,705
you just had to have.

26
00:01:48,882 --> 00:01:51,795
- We meant to write, Dad, but we just...
- "We?"

27
00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:56,259
Oh, me and my friend. I met this girl
at camp and we got really close.

28
00:01:56,432 --> 00:01:57,468
Great.

29
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,215
Practically like sisters.

30
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,643
- She was a lovely girl.
- "Lovely girl?"

31
00:02:03,522 --> 00:02:05,605
What, all of a sudden you're so proper?

32
00:02:06,692 --> 00:02:09,901
- Still biting those nails, I see.
- Dad, you noticed!

33
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,654
What do you mean, "noticed?" You've
been biting them since you could chew.

34
00:02:13,824 --> 00:02:16,817
But I've decided to stop, Dad.
It's a horrid habit.

35
00:02:17,035 --> 00:02:18,947
"Lovely girl," "horrid habit."

36
00:02:19,121 --> 00:02:22,159
What did I do, send you
to summer camp or finishing school?

37
00:02:22,332 --> 00:02:25,166
And why do you keep saying "Dad"
at the end of every sentence?

38
00:02:25,335 --> 00:02:28,328
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
I was doing it, Dad.

39
00:02:29,673 --> 00:02:31,039
Sorry, Dad.

40
00:02:32,676 --> 00:02:36,465
Do you want to know
why I keep saying "Dad?" The truth?

41
00:02:36,638 --> 00:02:39,346
'Cause you missed
your old man so much, right?

42
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:41,516
Exactly.

43
00:02:41,685 --> 00:02:46,851
It's because in my whole life - I mean,
you know, for the past eight weeks -

44
00:02:47,024 --> 00:02:51,143
I was never able to say the word "Dad."
Never. Not once.

45
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:53,482
And if you ask me,

46
00:02:53,655 --> 00:02:56,614
a dad is an irreplaceable person
in a girl's life.

47
00:02:57,034 --> 00:03:00,948
Think about it. There's a whole day
devoted to celebrating fathers.

48
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:03,784
Just imagine someone's life
without a father.

49
00:03:03,957 --> 00:03:05,949
Never buying a Father's Day card.

50
00:03:06,126 --> 00:03:08,118
Never sitting on their father's lap.

51
00:03:08,295 --> 00:03:09,877
Never being able to say, "Hi, Dad!"

52
00:03:10,047 --> 00:03:13,006
or, "What's up, Dad?"
or, "Catch you later, Dad."

53
00:03:13,175 --> 00:03:16,043
I mean, a baby's first words
are always "Dada," aren't they?

54
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,464
Let me see if I get this.
You missed being able to call me "Dad?"

55
00:03:20,641 --> 00:03:23,725
Yeah. I really have, Dad.

56
00:03:31,276 --> 00:03:33,563
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

57
00:03:33,737 --> 00:03:36,275
Now you're starting
to sound like your old self.

58
00:04:00,347 --> 00:04:03,090
Hello, gorgeous!

59
00:04:03,267 --> 00:04:05,429
Oh, look at you!

60
00:04:05,602 --> 00:04:07,764
Oh, you grew.

61
00:04:07,938 --> 00:04:11,773
Oh, we missed you so much.

62
00:04:11,984 --> 00:04:15,477
Hey. Don't you dare let your old man
talk you out of going back to camp, OK?

63
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:17,107
You're a growing girl. You need adventure.

64
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:19,565
- OK.
- You hungry?

65
00:04:20,576 --> 00:04:22,283
I made corn bread and chili.

66
00:04:22,452 --> 00:04:24,910
- Why are you so quiet? What's wrong?
- Nothing.

67
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,037
It's just I'm so happy to be home.

68
00:04:27,207 --> 00:04:30,120
Hey, did I hear something
about corn bread and chili?

69
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,793
Yeah, it's on the stove. So...

70
00:04:33,463 --> 00:04:37,503
Something's changed about you, Hal.
Hm. I can't put my finger on it,

71
00:04:37,676 --> 00:04:40,384
but something about you
has definitely changed.

72
00:04:40,554 --> 00:04:44,389
Really? Well, it's just the same old me.

73
00:04:45,475 --> 00:04:47,512
Honest.

74
00:04:49,771 --> 00:04:51,137
Hi, Sammy!

75
00:04:53,901 --> 00:04:56,609
What is wrong with you, you goofball?
It's Hallie.

76
00:04:56,778 --> 00:04:59,896
Oh, I probably just
smell like camp, that's all.

77
00:05:02,034 --> 00:05:05,198
What's the matter with you?
It's like you didn't even recognize her.

78
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:13,455
Wow, it's even better than the pictures.

79
00:05:15,672 --> 00:05:19,211
OK, kiddo.
What do you want to do first, huh?

80
00:05:19,384 --> 00:05:24,425
You want to eat and then unpack,
or we could unpack and then eat.

81
00:05:24,598 --> 00:05:27,386
Or we could eat while we unpack.

82
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:29,642
You mean I can eat in my room?

83
00:05:30,228 --> 00:05:32,720
Yeah, it's a definite possibility.

84
00:05:32,898 --> 00:05:36,437
Hey, Hal. When you're done, come on
down. There's someone I want you to meet.

85
00:05:36,693 --> 00:05:39,356
- OK, Dad.
- OK, Hal.

86
00:05:43,325 --> 00:05:45,817
Look at you, always eating.

87
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:50,200
- Did you tell her?
- No.

88
00:05:50,374 --> 00:05:51,660
Oh, Nicky.

89
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,491
Tell me what?

90
00:05:54,836 --> 00:05:58,830
Hal, it is none of my business how your
father makes a fool out of himself, OK?

91
00:05:59,007 --> 00:06:03,593
- He's a big boy. He can do what he wants.
- OK, OK. So, who is she?

92
00:06:05,847 --> 00:06:10,217
Her name's Meredith Blake.
She's a publicist from San Francisco.

93
00:06:10,394 --> 00:06:12,386
Your father hired her
at the beginning of the summer

94
00:06:12,562 --> 00:06:14,428
to do some publicity for the vineyard.

95
00:06:14,606 --> 00:06:18,646
If you ask me, she's doing a better job
of selling herself than the grapes.

96
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:22,028
What do you mean?

97
00:06:23,573 --> 00:06:26,907
Look, you and I both know your father's
not some kind of suave, debonair,

98
00:06:27,077 --> 00:06:28,409
bachelor-of-the-month type.

99
00:06:28,578 --> 00:06:32,037
So I gotta ask myself,
what does a hot young thing like that

100
00:06:32,207 --> 00:06:34,915
see in a guy who walks around
with his shirttail hanging out

101
00:06:35,085 --> 00:06:36,576
and a cereal bowl full of chili.

102
00:06:37,337 --> 00:06:41,547
Then I realized there's about a million
reasons why that girl's giggling.

103
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:46,378
All of them are sitting
at the Napa Valley Community Bank.

104
00:06:46,596 --> 00:06:49,054
You mean, you don't think
she even really likes him?

105
00:06:49,224 --> 00:06:51,307
Ah, what do I know?
But I tell you one thing,

106
00:06:51,476 --> 00:06:53,968
this one's got your father
eating out of the palm of her hand.

107
00:06:54,187 --> 00:06:57,897
They do everything together.
They ride together, they swim together.

108
00:06:58,066 --> 00:07:00,058
They go out to eat dinner every night.

109
00:07:00,235 --> 00:07:04,400
Do you know what? Meet her. See
for yourself. Don't let me influence you.
