- I ain't hungry.
- Well, if you like burgers, give 'em a try sometime.

29
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:55,458
Me, I can't usually get 'em
'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian,

30
00:01:55,524 --> 00:01:58,655
which pretty much makes me
a vegetarian.

You know why they call it that?

36
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:19,408
Uh, because of
the metric system?
