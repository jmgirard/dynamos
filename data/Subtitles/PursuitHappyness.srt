1
00:00:02,163 --> 00:00:04,374
- Taxi!
- Mr. Twistle.

2
00:00:04,583 --> 00:00:07,252
- Yeah, hi.
- Hi. Chris Gardner.

3
00:00:07,502 --> 00:00:09,296
Yeah, hi. Listen.
What can I do for you?

4
00:00:09,504 --> 00:00:12,549
I submitted an application for the
intern programme about a month ago...

5
00:00:12,757 --> 00:00:15,010
...and I would just love
to sit with you briefly...

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,178
Listen, I'm going
to Noe Valley, Chris.

7
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:20,682
- Take care of yourself.
- Mr. Twistle.

8
00:00:20,932 --> 00:00:23,226
Actually, I'm on my way
to Noe Valley also.

9
00:00:23,435 --> 00:00:25,186
How about we share a ride?

10
00:00:26,688 --> 00:00:28,857
- All right, get in.
- All right.

11
00:00:34,946 --> 00:00:37,699
So when I was in the Navy,
I worked for a doctor...

12
00:00:37,949 --> 00:00:40,744
...who loved to play golf,
hours every day...

13
00:00:40,952 --> 00:00:45,582
...and I would actually
perform medical procedures...

14
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,334
...when he'd leave me in the office.

15
00:00:47,542 --> 00:00:52,797
So I'm used to being in a position
where I have to make decisions and...

16
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:57,093
Mr. Twistle, listen.
This is a very important...

17
00:00:57,302 --> 00:00:59,512
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
This thing's impossible.

18
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,725
- I can do it.
- No, you can't. No one can.

19
00:01:03,975 --> 00:01:06,645
- That's bullshit.
- No, I'm pretty sure I can do it.

20
00:01:07,062 --> 00:01:10,232
- No, you can't.
- Let me see it.

21
00:01:10,815 --> 00:01:12,025
Give it here.

22
00:01:14,986 --> 00:01:19,282
Oh, yeah. Oh, wow,
you really messed it up.

23
00:01:19,491 --> 00:01:21,034
Sorry.

24
00:01:21,576 --> 00:01:27,541
It looks like it works around a swivel,
so the centre pieces never move.

25
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:30,835
So if it's yellow in the centre,
that's the yellow side.

26
00:01:31,086 --> 00:01:33,547
If it's red in the centre,
that's the red side.

27
00:01:33,755 --> 00:01:37,384
- Okay.
- So... You can slow down.

28
00:01:37,592 --> 00:01:40,637
Listen, we can drive around all day.
I don't believe you can do this.

29
00:01:40,845 --> 00:01:42,556
- Yeah, I can.
- No, you can't.

30
00:01:42,764 --> 00:01:43,932
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.

31
00:01:44,182 --> 00:01:46,059
I'm telling you, no one can.

32
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:50,230
See? That's all I ever do.

33
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:05,412
You almost have this side.

34
00:02:06,037 --> 00:02:07,497
Holy cow.

35
00:02:17,716 --> 00:02:21,511
- You almost had that one.
- I'm gonna get it.

36
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,812
Look at that.

37
00:02:54,085 --> 00:02:55,295
You're almost there.

38
00:03:19,027 --> 00:03:22,739
- 1710.
- This is me.

39
00:03:24,866 --> 00:03:26,243
Good job.

40
00:03:28,119 --> 00:03:31,206
- Goodbye.
- Yeah. I'll see you soon.

41
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,335
Where are you going, sir?

42
00:03:35,544 --> 00:03:38,547
Excuse me, sir.
Where are you going, please?

43
00:03:41,883 --> 00:03:43,593
Two... A couple of blocks.

44
00:03:43,802 --> 00:03:47,222
- Just flip around.
- Okay.
