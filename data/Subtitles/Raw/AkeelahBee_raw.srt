01:42:22,596 --> 01:42:24,056
Ladies and gentlemen,

1642
01:42:24,139 --> 01:42:27,226
we are down to the final
two championship words.

1643
01:42:27,309 --> 01:42:32,731
One or both of our spellers will walk away
with the first-place trophy.

1644
01:42:32,815 --> 01:42:34,316
Dylan, you're up.

1645
01:42:41,406 --> 01:42:42,741
"Logorrhea."

1646
01:42:42,825 --> 01:42:45,410
May I have the definition, please?

1647
01:42:45,494 --> 01:42:50,123
Logorrhea is excessive and often
incoherent talkativeness.

1648
01:42:56,713 --> 01:42:58,340
"Logorrhea."

1653
01:43:17,276 --> 01:43:19,111
"Logorrhea"?

1654
01:43:19,194 --> 01:43:20,654
Congratulations, Dylan.

1655
01:43:20,737 --> 01:43:23,574
You've won the Scripps
National Spelling Bee.

1656
01:43:23,657 --> 01:43:27,286
Yes! Yes!

1657
01:43:31,623 --> 01:43:32,875
Go get 'em.

1658
01:43:38,171 --> 01:43:39,923
Ladies and gentlemen,

1659
01:43:40,007 --> 01:43:42,217
please be seated for Akeelah's turn.

1661
01:43:48,557 --> 01:43:50,225
"Pulchritude."

1662
01:43:51,393 --> 01:43:53,437
"Pulchritude."

1663
01:43:59,026 --> 01:44:02,321
It's derived from
the Latin word <i>pulcher,</i>

1664
01:44:02,404 --> 01:44:05,240
meaning "beautiful",

1665
01:44:05,324 --> 01:44:07,701
- isn't it?
- That's correct.

Congratulations, Akeelah.

1674
01:44:28,597 --> 01:44:29,932
That's what I'm talking about!

1675
01:44:33,644 --> 01:44:35,145
<i>You know that feeling</i>

1676
01:44:35,228 --> 01:44:36,521
<i>where everything feels right,</i>

1677
01:44:36,605 --> 01:44:40,817
<i>where you don't have to worry
about tomorrow or yesterday,</i>

1678
01:44:40,901 --> 01:44:43,445
<i>but you feel safe</i>

1679
01:44:43,528 --> 01:44:45,948
<i>and know you're doing
the best you can?</i>

1680
01:44:46,031 --> 01:44:48,075
<i>There's a word for that feeling.</i>

1681
01:44:48,158 --> 01:44:50,327
<i>It's called love.</i>

1682
01:44:50,410 --> 01:44:53,830
<i>L-O-V-E.</i>

1683
01:44:53,914 --> 01:44:56,583
<i>And it's what I feel for all my family</i>

1684
01:44:56,667 --> 01:45:00,170
<i>and all my coaches
in my neighborhood</i>

1685
01:45:00,253 --> 01:45:01,880
<i>where I come from,</i>

1686
01:45:01,964 --> 01:45:05,467
<i>where I learned how to spell.</i>
