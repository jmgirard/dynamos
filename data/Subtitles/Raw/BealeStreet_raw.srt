- Hey.

23
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:43,767
Alonzo?

24
00:03:47,236 --> 00:03:49,206
Alonzo, we...

25
00:03:52,142 --> 00:03:54,511
We're gonna have a baby.

<i>That means more to him
than it does to me,</i>

(LAUGHING)

34
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,880
You tell my daddy?

35
00:04:31,882 --> 00:04:33,981
- Not yet.
- You tell your folks?

36
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:36,253
Not yet, but don't worry
about them.

37
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,757
I just wanted to tell you first.

will take care for me.

43
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:06,916
You ain't got to worry.

44
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,821
And, anyway, we'll have you
out of here before then.

45
00:05:14,824 --> 00:05:17,060
Are you sure about that?

46
00:05:17,927 --> 00:05:21,598
I'm always sure about that.
