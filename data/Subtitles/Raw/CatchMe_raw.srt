(CHUCKLING)

937
00:44:42,443 --> 00:44:44,444
My son, the birdman.

938
00:44:44,445 --> 00:44:45,479
Some uniform, Frank.

939
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,481
What do you think?

940
00:44:47,482 --> 00:44:49,148
Nice.

941
00:44:49,149 --> 00:44:50,817

(CLEARS THROAT)

943
00:44:53,821 --> 00:44:55,989
So, Dad... Daddy, have you
gotten the postcards?

944
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:57,323
Of course.

945
00:44:57,324 --> 00:44:59,626
This fork is ice cold.

946
00:44:59,627 --> 00:45:03,296
No, no, Dad, th-that's
a chilled salad fork.

947
00:45:03,297 --> 00:45:07,967

It's a fancy restaurant, you know.

Well, here...

950
00:45:13,775 --> 00:45:15,709
I-I got you something.

951
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:17,444
What's that?

952
00:45:17,445 --> 00:45:19,646
Open it.

953
00:45:23,451 --> 00:45:25,285
You know what those are, right?

954
00:45:25,286 --> 00:45:27,287
Those are the keys

955
00:45:27,288 --> 00:45:30,290
to a 1965 Cadillac
DeVille convertible.

956
00:45:30,291 --> 00:45:32,192

959
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,567
Are you giving me a Cadillac?

960
00:45:40,568 --> 00:45:42,302
Yeah. I'm giving you
a Cadillac.

961
00:45:42,303 --> 00:45:44,071
Dad, sh-she's parked
downstairs.

962

When we're done eating lunch

963
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,541
why don't you, you know,
drive on over to Mom's house

964
00:45:48,542 --> 00:45:50,710
pick her up,
take a little joyride?

965
00:45:50,711 --> 00:45:52,512
Do you know what would happen

966
00:45:52,513 --> 00:45:53,814
if the IRS found out

967
00:45:53,815 --> 00:45:57,317
I was driving around
in a new coupe?

968
00:45:57,318 --> 00:45:59,619
I took the train here, Frank.

969
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:01,989
I'm taking the train home.

970
00:46:03,658 --> 00:46:05,692
All right.

971
00:46:10,698 --> 00:46:13,801
I have plenty of money.

972
00:46:13,802 --> 00:46:16,203
You know, if you
ever, ever need anything...

973
00:46:16,204 --> 00:46:17,537
You worried?

974
00:46:17,538 --> 00:46:20,073
About me?

975
00:46:20,074 --> 00:46:21,708
No, I'm not...
I'm not worried.

976
00:46:21,709 --> 00:46:24,145
You think I can't
buy my own car?

977
00:46:24,146 --> 00:46:28,715
Two mice fell in a
bucket of cream, Frank.

978
00:46:28,716 --> 00:46:30,583
Which one am I?

979
00:46:30,584 --> 00:46:33,453
You're that second mouse.

980
00:46:35,089 --> 00:46:38,725
I went by the store today.

981
00:46:38,726 --> 00:46:40,694
I had to close the
store for awhile.

982
00:46:40,695 --> 00:46:42,262
It's all about timing, Frank.

983
00:46:42,263 --> 00:46:43,864
The goddamn government
knows that.

984
00:46:43,865 --> 00:46:45,465
They hit you when you're down.

985
00:46:45,466 --> 00:46:46,834
I wasn't going to let them

986
00:46:46,835 --> 00:46:48,401
take it from me, so I just...

987
00:46:48,402 --> 00:46:51,505
shut the doors myself,
called their bluff.

988
00:46:56,077 --> 00:46:58,245
Sooner or later,
they'll forget about me.

989
00:46:58,246 --> 00:47:00,680
I understand, I...

990
00:47:00,681 --> 00:47:04,084
Have you told Ma?

991
00:47:05,753 --> 00:47:10,290
She's so stubborn, your mother.

992
00:47:12,927 --> 00:47:14,261
Don't worry.

993
00:47:14,262 --> 00:47:16,629
I'm not going to let her go
without a fight.

994
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:17,865
I been fighting for us...

997
00:47:24,438 --> 00:47:27,040
Since the day we... we met.

998
00:47:27,041 --> 00:47:28,909
Daddy, out of all those men

999
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:32,379
you were the one that
took her home, remember that.

1000
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:35,815
200 men, sitting in
that tiny social hall

1001
00:47:35,816 --> 00:47:38,017
watching her dance.

1002
00:47:40,288 --> 00:47:42,789
What was the name of that town?

1003
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:44,124
Montrichard, Dad.

1004
00:47:44,125 --> 00:47:45,625
Yeah.

1005
00:47:45,626 --> 00:47:48,461
I didn't speak a word of French

1006
00:47:48,462 --> 00:47:51,932
and six weeks later,
she was my wi...

1007
00:47:51,933 --> 00:47:54,935
She's your wife.

1008
00:47:54,936 --> 00:47:59,206
My son bought me
a Cadillac today.

1009
00:47:59,207 --> 00:48:03,243
I think that calls for a toast.

To the best damn pilot
in the sky.

00:48:14,155 --> 00:48:15,855
It's not what you think.

1014
00:48:15,856 --> 00:48:18,525
I'm just a copilot.

1015
00:48:18,526 --> 00:48:22,195
You see these people
staring at you?

1016
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:27,167
These are the most
powerful people

1018
00:48:28,803 --> 00:48:31,071
and they keep peeking
over their shoulders

1019
00:48:31,072 --> 00:48:33,073
wondering where
you're going tonight.

1020
00:48:33,074 --> 00:48:34,541
Where you going, Frank?

1021
00:48:34,542 --> 00:48:38,245
Dad, nobody's staring at me.

1022
00:48:38,246 --> 00:48:40,614
Some place exotic?

1023
00:48:42,516 --> 00:48:45,352
Just tell me where you're going.
