1362
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,980
You know what sucks?

1363
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:38,420
Realizing that everything you believe in
is complete and utter bullshit.

1364
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:40,511
- It sucks.
- What do you mean?

1365
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:44,580
Uh, you know, destiny,
and soul mates, and true love,

1366
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:49,310
and all that childhood
fairy tale nonsense.

1367
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,715
You were right.
I-I should have listened to you.

1368
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:52,640
No.

1369
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:55,310
Yeah. What?
What are you smiling at?

1370
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:58,954
- Tom.
- What?

1371
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:03,380
What are you looking at me
like that for?

1372
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:06,100
Well, you know,

1373
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:08,380
I guess it's 'cause...

1374
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,020
I was sitting in a deli
and reading Dorian Gray

1375
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:13,580
and... a guy comes up to me...

1376
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:16,260
and asked me about it,

1377
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:19,352
and... now he's my husband.

1378
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,660
Yeah. And... so?

1379
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:28,620
So, what if I'd gone to the movies?

1380
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:33,620
What if I had gone
somewhere else for lunch?

1381
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:37,030
What if I'd gotten there
10 minutes later?

1382
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,620
It was-

1383
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:43,029
It was meant to be.

1384
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:45,799
And I just kept thinking,

1385
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:49,540
- Tom was right.
- No.

1386
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:51,700
Yeah, I did.

1387
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:54,314
[Laughs]
I did.

1388
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,520
It just wasn't me
that you were right about.

1389
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:32,020
I should go.

1390
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:35,112
But I'm really happy to see
that you're doing well.
