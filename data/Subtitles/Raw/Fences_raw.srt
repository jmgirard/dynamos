1866
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:09,429
We ain't talking about baseball!

1867
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:11,896
We talking about you going off
and laying up with another woman,

1868
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:12,976
then bringing it home to me.

1869
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,336
That's what we're talking about.
We're not talkin' about no baseball!

1870
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:16,616
Rose, you're not listening to me.

1871
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:19,518
I'm trying to explain it to you
the best way I know how.

1872
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:22,354
It's not easy for me to admit

1873
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:25,552
that I've been standing
in the same place for 18 years!

1874
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:28,154
Well, I've been standing with you!

1875
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:32,279
I've been right here with you, Troy!
I got a life, too.

1876
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:36,592
I gave 18 years of my life
to stand in the same spot as you!

1877
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:38,636
Don't you think
I ever wanted other things?

1878
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:40,836
Don't you think
I had dreams and hopes?

1879
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:43,514
What about my life? What about me?

1880
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,200
Don't you think it ever crossed my mind
to want to know other men?

1881
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:50,592
That I wanted to lay up somewhere
and forget about my responsibilities?

1882
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:52,272
That I wanted someone
to make me laugh,

1883
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:54,396
so I could feel good?

1884
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,550
You're not the only one
who's got wants and needs.

1885
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:58,591
But I held on to you, Troy.

1886
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:02,832
I took all my feelings,
my wants and needs and dreams,

1887
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:04,717
and I buried them inside you.

1888
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:07,075
I planted a seed
and watched and prayed over it.

1889
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:10,152
I planted myself inside you
and waited to bloom!

1890
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:14,074
And it didn't take me no 18 years
to realize the soil was hard and rocky,

1891
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,276
and it wasn't never gonna bloom!

1892
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:19,272
But I held on to you, Troy.
I held you tighter.

1893
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:21,351
You was my husband.

1894
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:24,079
I owed you everything I had.

1895
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:26,833
Every part of me I could find to give you.

1896
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:30,748
And upstairs in that bedroom,
with the darkness falling in on me,

1897
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:34,953
I gave everything I had
to try and erase the doubt

1898
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,713
that you wasn't the finest man
in the world.

1899
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:40,473
And wherever you was going,
I was gonna be there with you,

1900
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:43,034
because you was my husband.

1901
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:47,472
'Cause that's the only way
I was gonna survive as your wife.

1902
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:52,395
You always talking about what you give
and what you don't have to give.

1903
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:54,798
But you take, too, Troy.

1904
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:57,519
You take
and don't even know nobody's giving.

1905
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:58,656
You say I take and don't give.

1906
01:22:58,680 --> 01:22:59,829
Troy, you're hurting me.

1907
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:02,176
- Troy, you're hurting my arm, let go!
- I gave you everything I got.

1908
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,256
Don't you tell that lie on me.

1909
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:04,679
- Mama!
- Don't you tell that lie!

1910
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:06,273
Troy, you're hurting me!

1911
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,233
Troy! Troy!

1912
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:12,315
All right. That's strike two.

1913
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:17,358
You stay away from around me, boy.
Don't you strike out.

1914
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:21,031
You're living with a full count.
