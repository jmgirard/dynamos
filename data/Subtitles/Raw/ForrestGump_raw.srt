1548
02:09:22,020 --> 02:09:25,355
You died on a Saturday morning.

1549
02:09:27,066 --> 02:09:30,819
And I had you placed
here under our tree.

1550
02:09:35,700 --> 02:09:40,537
And I had that house of your father's
bulldozed to the ground.

1551
02:09:44,667 --> 02:09:46,335
Mama

1552
02:09:47,420 --> 02:09:52,424
always said that dying was a part of life.

1553
02:09:55,845 --> 02:09:58,180
I sure wish it wasn't.

1554
02:10:00,850 --> 02:10:04,603
Little Forrest is doing just fine.

1555
02:10:05,938 --> 02:10:07,022
But...

1556
02:10:07,273 --> 02:10:09,941
About to start school again soon,

1557
02:10:11,778 --> 02:10:15,571
and I make his breakfast, lunch
and dinner every day.

1558
02:10:17,741 --> 02:10:23,746
I make sure he combs his hair
and brushes his teeth every day.

1559
02:10:26,875 --> 02:10:29,460
Teaching him how to play Ping-Pong.

1560
02:10:30,754 --> 02:10:31,796
Okay.

1561
02:10:32,047 --> 02:10:33,214
He's really good.

1562
02:10:33,298 --> 02:10:35,424
Forrest, you go.

1563
02:10:39,638 --> 02:10:41,222
We fish a lot.

1564
02:10:44,768 --> 02:10:48,229
(SOBBING) And every night, we read
a book. He's so smart, Jenny.

1565
02:10:51,483 --> 02:10:53,734
You'd be so proud of him.

1566
02:10:55,445 --> 02:10:56,904
I am.

1567
02:10:57,948 --> 02:11:01,158
He wrote you a letter.

1568
02:11:02,744 --> 02:11:04,787
And he says I can't read it.

1569
02:11:04,913 --> 02:11:08,457
I'm not supposed to,
so I'll just leave it here for you.

1570
02:11:24,516 --> 02:11:25,850
Jenny,

1571
02:11:31,648 --> 02:11:34,859
I don't know if Mama was right,

1572
02:11:36,194 --> 02:11:37,695
or if it's Lieutenant Dan.

1573
02:11:37,821 --> 02:11:40,406
I don't know

1574
02:11:40,490 --> 02:11:44,994
if we each have a destiny,

1575
02:11:47,038 --> 02:11:52,168
or if we're all just floating around
accidental-like on a breeze.

1576
02:11:56,673 --> 02:11:58,507
But I think

1577
02:12:00,385 --> 02:12:02,178
maybe it's both.

1578
02:12:06,516 --> 02:12:09,393
Maybe both is happening
at the same time.

1579
02:12:15,525 --> 02:12:17,526
But I miss you, Jenny.

1580
02:12:23,909 --> 02:12:28,329
If there's anything you need,
I won't be far away.
