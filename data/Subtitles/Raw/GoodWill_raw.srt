517
00:39:21,511 --> 00:39:25,460
Hey, you know you'd be better off shoving that cigarette
up your ass. It'd probably be healthier for you.

518
00:39:25,598 --> 00:39:29,725
- Yeah, I know. It really gets in the way of my yoga.
- You work out, huh?

519
00:39:29,852 --> 00:39:32,556
- What, you lift?
- Yeah.

520
00:39:32,687 --> 00:39:34,680
- Uh, Nautilus?
- No, free weights.

521
00:39:34,814 --> 00:39:36,391
- Oh, really? - Yeah.
- Free weights, huh?

522
00:39:36,524 --> 00:39:38,315
- Yeah, big time. -
Yeah? - Just like that.

523
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:40,731
- What do you bench?
- 285. What do you bench?

524
00:39:43,154 --> 00:39:45,230
You paint that?

525
00:39:45,365 --> 00:39:48,780
Yeah. You paint? Do you sculpt?

526
00:39:48,909 --> 00:39:50,736
- No.
- Do you like art?

527
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:55,239
Do you like music?

528
00:39:55,373 --> 00:39:57,412
This is a real piece of shit.

529
00:39:57,542 --> 00:39:59,415
Oh. Well, tell me
what you really think.

530
00:39:59,543 --> 00:40:02,876
Uh, just, uh, the linear
and impressionistic mix...

531
00:40:03,005 --> 00:40:05,246
makes a very muddled composition.

532
00:40:05,382 --> 00:40:09,165
It's also a Winslow Homer rip-off, except
you got whitey, uh, rowin' the boat there.

533
00:40:09,302 --> 00:40:11,175
Well, it's art, Monet.
It wasn't very good.

534
00:40:11,303 --> 00:40:13,924
- That's not really what concerns me though.
- What concerns you?

535
00:40:14,056 --> 00:40:16,463
- Just the colouring.
- You know what the real bitch of it is?

536
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:18,592
It's paint-by-number.

537
00:40:18,726 --> 00:40:21,181
Is it colour-by-number? Because
the colours are fascinating to me.

538
00:40:21,312 --> 00:40:22,889
- Aren't they, really? What about that?
- You bet.

539
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:25,939
I think you're about one step away
from cuttin' your fuckin' ear off.

540
00:40:26,066 --> 00:40:28,141
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

541
00:40:28,276 --> 00:40:32,024
Think I should move to the south
of France, change my name to Vincent?

542
00:40:32,154 --> 00:40:33,981
You ever heard the sayin',
"any port in a storm"?

543
00:40:34,114 --> 00:40:37,031
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Maybe that means you.

544
00:40:37,158 --> 00:40:38,534
In what way?

545
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,945
- Uh, maybe you're in the middle of a storm, a big fuckin' storm.
- Yeah, maybe.

546
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,080
The sky's fallin' on your head. The
waves are crashin' over your little boat.

547
00:40:45,207 --> 00:40:47,413
The oars are about to snap.

548
00:40:47,542 --> 00:40:49,202
You just piss in you pants.
You're cryin' for the harbour.

549
00:40:49,335 --> 00:40:51,624
So maybe you do
what you gotta do to get out.

550
00:40:51,754 --> 00:40:54,079
You know, maybe you became
a psychologist.

551
00:40:54,214 --> 00:40:57,797
Bingo. That's it. Let me do my job now.
You start with me. Come on.

552
00:41:00,178 --> 00:41:03,926
- Maybe you married the wrong woman.
- Maybe you should watch your mouth!

553
00:41:05,682 --> 00:41:08,007
Watch it right there, chief,
all right?

554
00:41:10,603 --> 00:41:12,477
Ah.

555
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:18,731
Mmm, that's it, isn't it?

556
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:21,102
You married the wrong woman.

557
00:41:22,655 --> 00:41:26,984
What happened?
What, did she leave you?

558
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:29,406
Was she, you know,
banging some other guy?

559
00:41:31,496 --> 00:41:34,911
If you ever disrespect my wife again,
I will end you.

560
00:41:35,041 --> 00:41:37,080
I will fuckin' end you.

561
00:41:37,209 --> 00:41:39,000
Got that, chief?

562
00:41:41,171 --> 00:41:45,002
- Time's up.
- Yeah.
