02:47:46,473 --> 02:47:49,975
MARJORIE:
Does it hurt yet? I hope it does.

1864
02:47:50,810 --> 02:47:53,062
I hope it hurts like hell.

1865
02:47:54,981 --> 02:47:59,068
John Coffey, you've been condemned to
die in the chair by a jury of your peers.

1866
02:47:59,319 --> 02:48:02,863
Sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

1867
02:48:03,156 --> 02:48:06,408
Do you have anything to say
before sentence is carried out?

1868
02:48:08,161 --> 02:48:10,662
I'm sorry for what I am.

1869
02:48:22,675 --> 02:48:24,426
Please, boss...

1870
02:48:25,845 --> 02:48:28,514
...don't put that thing over my face.

1871
02:48:29,682 --> 02:48:32,017
Don't put me in the dark.

1872
02:48:32,852 --> 02:48:35,187
I's afraid of the dark.

1873
02:48:44,864 --> 02:48:46,532
All right, John.

1874
02:49:06,719 --> 02:49:09,721
[SOFTLY]
Heaven, I'm in heaven

1875
02:49:09,931 --> 02:49:12,724
Heaven, heaven

1876
02:49:12,976 --> 02:49:14,810
I'm in heaven

1877
02:49:15,395 --> 02:49:17,980
Heaven, heaven

1878
02:49:18,231 --> 02:49:19,940
I'm in heaven

1879
02:49:40,837 --> 02:49:42,462
John Coffey...

1880
02:49:43,464 --> 02:49:46,592
...electricity shall pass through
your body until you are dead...

1881
02:49:46,759 --> 02:49:48,969
...in accordance with state law.

1882
02:49:51,347 --> 02:49:55,100
May God have mercy on your soul.

1883
02:50:29,427 --> 02:50:30,636
Paul.

1884
02:50:33,806 --> 02:50:35,724
You have to say it.

1885
02:50:37,393 --> 02:50:39,645
You have to give the order.

1886
02:50:57,664 --> 02:50:59,998
COFFEY'S VOICE:
He killed them with they love.

1887
02:51:00,166 --> 02:51:05,045
That's how it is every day
all over the world.

1888
02:51:18,851 --> 02:51:20,269
Roll on two.

1889
