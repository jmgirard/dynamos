1257
01:40:44,413 --> 01:40:46,666
- Mr. Wood.
- Good luck, Your Majesty.

1258
01:40:49,961 --> 01:40:51,087
Mr. Wood.

1259
01:40:52,046 --> 01:40:55,550
- You've redecorated, Logue.
- I made it cozy.

1260
01:40:57,301 --> 01:41:00,555
- Some fresh air.
- There you are, darling.

1261
01:41:05,268 --> 01:41:06,895
I'm a thistle-sifter.

1262
01:41:06,978 --> 01:41:10,073
I've a sieve of sifted thistles
and a sieve of unsifted thistles.

1263
01:41:10,147 --> 01:41:13,777
A sieve of sifted thistles
and a sieve of unsifted thistles.

1264
01:41:13,859 --> 01:41:15,987
- Because I'm...
- Bertie. Darling.

1265
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:18,198
Make sure it's not switched on.

1266
01:41:18,281 --> 01:41:20,158
Remember, the red light
will blink four times,

1267
01:41:20,241 --> 01:41:21,993
then I've asked them to turn it off.

1268
01:41:22,076 --> 01:41:25,125
'Cause we don't want that evil eye
staring at you all the way through.

1269
01:41:26,664 --> 01:41:28,507
One minute, sir.

1270
01:41:30,543 --> 01:41:32,671
I'm sure you'll be splendid.

1271
01:41:44,682 --> 01:41:46,275
Forty seconds, sir.

1272
01:41:49,186 --> 01:41:50,779
Logue.

1273
01:41:51,606 --> 01:41:53,859
However this turns out...

1274
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:58,659
...I don't know how to thank you...
for what you've done.

1275
01:42:01,532 --> 01:42:03,125
Knighthood?

1276
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:09,253
Twenty seconds.

1277
01:42:15,087 --> 01:42:19,308
Forget everything else,
and just say it to me.

1278
01:42:20,551 --> 01:42:23,350
Say it to me as a friend.

1279
01:43:04,804 --> 01:43:06,932
In this grave...

1280
01:43:08,349 --> 01:43:09,896
..hour..

1281
01:43:15,815 --> 01:43:21,788
...perhaps the most fateful
in our history...

1282
01:43:24,115 --> 01:43:26,493
...I send...

1283
01:43:26,575 --> 01:43:29,124
...to every household of my...

1284
01:43:31,914 --> 01:43:33,757
...a-peoples...

1285
01:43:36,335 --> 01:43:38,212
...both at home...

1286
01:43:42,383 --> 01:43:44,431
...and overseas...

1287
01:43:53,936 --> 01:43:55,984
...this message...

1288
01:43:56,981 --> 01:44:01,703
...spoken with the same
depth of feeling...

1289
01:44:02,486 --> 01:44:04,488
...for each one of you...

1290
01:44:04,989 --> 01:44:10,086
...as if I were able
to cross your threshold

1291
01:44:10,161 --> 01:44:14,382
and speak to you... myself.

1292
01:44:18,002 --> 01:44:22,803
For the second time
in the lives of most of us...

1293
01:44:22,882 --> 01:44:25,431
...we are... at...

1294
01:44:25,509 --> 01:44:26,852
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

1295
01:44:26,927 --> 01:44:28,179
...at war.

1296
01:44:29,138 --> 01:44:30,606
Very good.

1297
01:44:32,183 --> 01:44:36,438
Over and over again...

1298
01:44:37,521 --> 01:44:40,900
...we have tried to find...

1299
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:48,708
...a peaceful way out
of the differences...

1300
01:44:49,742 --> 01:44:52,370
...between ourselves...

1301
01:44:52,453 --> 01:44:54,000
...and those...

1302
01:44:54,705 --> 01:45:00,053
...who are now our... enemies.

1303
01:45:02,046 --> 01:45:06,051
But it has been... in vain.

1304
01:45:06,884 --> 01:45:11,936
We have been forced into a conflict,

1305
01:45:12,014 --> 01:45:16,941
for we are called
to meet the challenge of a principle,

1306
01:45:17,019 --> 01:45:21,240
which, if it were to prevail,

1307
01:45:21,315 --> 01:45:25,866
would be fatal to any civilized order

1308
01:45:25,945 --> 01:45:27,993
in the world.

1309
01:45:28,906 --> 01:45:31,580
Such a principle,

1310
01:45:31,659 --> 01:45:37,587
stripped of all disguise,

1311
01:45:37,665 --> 01:45:40,794
is surely the mere...

1312
01:45:43,921 --> 01:45:47,892
...primitive doctrine that might...

1313
01:45:49,426 --> 01:45:51,019
...is right.

1314
01:45:51,971 --> 01:45:57,819
For the sake of all
that we ourselves hold dean

1315
01:45:57,893 --> 01:46:01,488
it is unthinkable

1316
01:46:01,564 --> 01:46:06,240
that we should refuse to meet...

1317
01:46:06,318 --> 01:46:07,991
...the challenge.

1318
01:46:10,531 --> 01:46:15,287
It is to this high purpose

1319
01:46:15,369 --> 01:46:18,043
that I now call

1320
01:46:18,122 --> 01:46:22,093
my people at home,

1321
01:46:22,167 --> 01:46:26,673
and my peoples across the seas,

1322
01:46:26,755 --> 01:46:31,511
who will make our cause their own.

1323
01:46:31,594 --> 01:46:36,600
I ask them to stand calm

1324
01:46:36,682 --> 01:46:39,856
and firm and united

1325
01:46:39,935 --> 01:46:43,985
in this time of trial.

1326
01:46:44,064 --> 01:46:46,817
The task will be hard.

1327
01:46:47,776 --> 01:46:51,747
There may be dark days ahead,

1328
01:46:51,822 --> 01:46:57,670
and war can no longer be confined

1329
01:46:57,745 --> 01:47:00,043
to the battlefield.

1330
01:47:00,122 --> 01:47:03,126
But we can only do the right

1331
01:47:03,208 --> 01:47:05,802
as we see the right,

1332
01:47:05,878 --> 01:47:09,849
and reverently commit

1333
01:47:09,924 --> 01:47:14,395
our cause to God.

1334
01:47:16,263 --> 01:47:19,938
If one and all we keep

1335
01:47:20,017 --> 01:47:24,944
resolutely faithful to it,

1336
01:47:25,022 --> 01:47:30,950
then, with God's help,

1337
01:47:31,028 --> 01:47:34,908
we shall... prevail.
