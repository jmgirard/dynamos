[sighs]

1586
01:25:42,325 --> 01:25:44,242
Excuse me. What day is it?

1587
01:25:44,244 --> 01:25:46,159
Sunday.

1588
01:25:46,161 --> 01:25:47,244
Thank you.

[phone ringing]

1595
01:26:58,151 --> 01:27:00,609
[Larry] Hi. You've reached
the McPherson family.

1596
01:27:00,611 --> 01:27:02,444
Please leave a message.
Thank you.

1597
01:27:02,446 --> 01:27:03,947
[beeps]

1598
01:27:03,949 --> 01:27:05,075
Hi, Mom and Dad.

1599
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:08,911
It's me. Christine.

1600
01:27:10,579 --> 01:27:13,165
It's the name you gave me.
It's a good one.

1601
01:27:16,002 --> 01:27:17,754
Dad, this is more for Mom.

1602
01:27:20,923 --> 01:27:22,551
Hey, Mom.

1603
01:27:25,178 --> 01:27:31,724
Did you feel emotional the first
time that you drove in Sacramento?

1604
01:27:31,726 --> 01:27:35,519
I did, and I wanted to tell you,

1605
01:27:35,521 --> 01:27:38,440
but we weren't really talking
when it happened.

1606
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:42,860
All those bends I've
known my whole life,

1607
01:27:42,862 --> 01:27:48,241
and stores and the whole thing.

1608
01:27:48,243 --> 01:27:54,581
[Marion's indistinct voice]

1609
01:27:54,583 --> 01:27:56,960
[Marion's indistinct voice
continues]

1610
01:28:07,387 --> 01:28:08,972
But I wanted to tell you...

1611
01:28:11,432 --> 01:28:13,100
I love you. [sighs]

1612
01:28:14,436 --> 01:28:17,105
Thank you. I'm...

1613
01:28:20,066 --> 01:28:21,067
Thank you.

1614
01:28:26,408 --> 01:28:31,408
...

1615
01:28:31,410 --> 01:28:32,410
