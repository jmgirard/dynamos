1224
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:35,809
- Excuse you. You're in my way.
- She's a student. She can't defend you.

1225
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:40,568
Massachusetts Supreme
Judicial Court Ruling 3.03.

1226
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:41,881
See?

1227
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:46,600
- Thank you, David.
- Counselors, approach the bench.

1228
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,727
- You're not going up there.
- Oh, yes, I am.

1229
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:52,724
I'm sorry. Maybe you
didn't hear me. You're fired.

1230
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:56,527
Counselors, now! All of you.

1231
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:02,485
Elle Woods, Your Honor.

1232
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:06,326
Rule 3.03 of Supreme Judicial Court
states that a law student

1233
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,881
may appear on behalf
of a defendant in criminal proceedings

1234
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:11,407
Your Honor,
I have no problem with this.

1235
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:14,882
- I do. I'm not allowing it.
- But you agreed last night.

1236
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:17,247
In your office,
when we were discussing my career?

1237
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:23,845
The ruling also states that you need
a licensed attorney to supervise you.

1238
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,049
- Mr. Callahan?
- That I won't agree to.

1239
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:29,567
I'll supervise, Your Honor.

1240
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:33,080
Well, then, Ms. Woods, proceed.

1241
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,204
Thank you, Your Honor.

1242
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,809
(chuckling)

1243
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,291
- Hi.
- Hi.

1244
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,731
Enjoy prison.

1245
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:55,680
Mrs. Windham,
you do realize what you're doing?

1246
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,171
Absolutely.

1247
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:04,522
- Oh, my God. There she is. Elle!
- Elle, we came to see your trial.

1248
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:09,527
Oh, look, how cute! There's, like,
a judge and everything. And jury people.

1249
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:13,211
- Vote for Elle!
- Ladies, take a seat.

1250
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,288
Go, girl.

1251
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:23,523
Do you swear to tell the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1252
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:25,364
- I do.
- Be seated.

1253
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:29,801
Ms. Woods, you may
begin your questioning.

1254
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:37,491
First of all, I would like
to point out that,

1255
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:39,523
not only is there
no proof in this case,

1256
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:43,930
but there's a complete
lack of mens rea,

1257
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:47,801
which, by definition,
tells us that there can be no crime

1258
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:50,167
without a... vicious will.

1259
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:53,925
I am aware of the meaning of mens rea.

1260
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:57,562
What I'm unaware of is why
you're giving me a vocabulary lesson

1261
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:00,166
when you should be
questioning your witness.

1262
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:03,930
Yes, Your Honor.

1263
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:08,566
Ms. Windham...

1264
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,408
When you arrived back at the house...

1265
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:13,966
...was your father there?

1266
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:16,762
Not that I saw. But like I said,

1267
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:19,127
I went straight upstairs
to take a shower.

1268
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:24,803
And... when you came downstairs,
what happened?

1269
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:28,443
I saw Brooke standing over his body...

1270
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:31,042
...drenched in his blood.

1271
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:41,322
- But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
- No, she'd stashed it by then.

1272
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:43,289
Move to strike that
from the record, Your Honor.

1273
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:45,442
- It's speculation.
- So stricken.

1274
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:49,241
Go ahead.

1275
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:57,410
Ms. Windham, did you hear a shot fired?

1276
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:59,883
No. I was in the shower.

1277
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:02,361
OK.

1278
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:06,127
So... sometime in the 20 minutes

1279
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:07,964
that you were in the shower...

1280
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:09,961
...your father was shot?

1281
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:11,801
I guess.

1282
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:15,930
Your father was shot
while you were in the shower...

1283
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:19,683
...but you didn't
hear the shot because...

1284
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,443
...because you were in the shower?

1285
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:30,480
Yes. I was washing my hair.

1286
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,410
- (barks)

1287
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:37,246
- Where is she going with this?
- Have a little faith, Gerard.

1288
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:49,566
Ms. Windham,
what had you done earlier that day?

1289
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:53,006
I got up, got a latte,

1290
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:56,289
went to the gym,
got a perm and came home.

1291
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:00,887
Where you got in the shower?

1292
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:05,764
I believe the witness has made it
clear that she was "in the shower."

1293
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:08,207
(all chuckling)

1294
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,689
Yes, Your Honor.

1295
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:17,447
Ms. Windham,
had you ever gotten a perm before?

1296
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:20,850
- Yes.
- How many, would you say?

1297
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:24,201
Two a year since I was 12.

1298
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,411
You do the math.

1299
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:30,409
You know, a girl in my sorority,
Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once.

1300
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:33,809
We all tried to talk her out of it.
Curls weren't a good look for her.

1301
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:35,930
She didn't have your bone structure.

1302
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:37,081
Aww.

1303
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:39,561
But thankfully, that same day,

1304
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:41,722
she entered the Beta Delta Pi
wet T-shirt contest,

1305
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:43,723
where she was completely
hosed down from head to toe.

1306
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:46,850
Objection! Why is this relevant?

1307
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,129
- I have a point. I promise.
- Then make it.

1308
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:52,570
Yes, ma'am.

1309
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:57,006
Chutney, why were Tracy Marcinko's
curls ruined when she got hosed down?

1310
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:00,649
- Because they got wet.
- Exactly.

1311
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:03,411
Because isn't it the first cardinal
rule of perm maintenance

1312
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:05,767
that you're forbidden
to wet your hair for at least 24 hours

1313
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:07,888
after getting a perm
at the risk of deactivating

1314
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:12,170
-the ammonium thioglycolate?
- Yes...

1315
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:15,449
And wouldn't somebody who's had,
say 30 perms before in their life

1316
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,602
be well aware of this rule?

1317
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:20,650
And if you weren't washing your hair,
as I suspect you weren't,

1318
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:24,009
because your curls are still intact,
wouldn't you have heard the gunshot?

1319
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:26,811
And if, in fact, you had heard the
gunshot, Brooke Windham

1320
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:29,964
wouldn't have had time to hide
the gun before you got downstairs,

1321
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:32,845
which would mean that you would've
had to have found Mrs. Windham

1322
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:36,522
with a gun in her hand to make
your story plausible. Isn't that right?

1323
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:39,047
She's my age, did she tell you that?

1324
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,521
How would you feel if your father
married someone your age?

1325
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:44,206
You, however, had time to hide the gun,
didn't you, Chutney?

1326
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:46,840
- After you shot your father.
- I didn't mean to shoot him!

1327
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,207
I thought it was you
walking through the door!

1328
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:51,328
(crowd exclaiming)

1329
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:55,882
Order! Order! Order.

1330
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,841
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

1331
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,809
Oh, my God.

1332
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,688
Bailiff, take the witness into custody,

1333
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:08,969
where she will be charged
for the murder of Heyworth Windham.

1334
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:12,406
In the matter of
The State v. Brooke Windham,

1335
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,244
this case is dismissed.

1336
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,482
Mrs. Windham, you are free to go.

1337
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:17,641
Yes!

1338
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:20,371
(all cheering)
