157
00:13:09,495 --> 00:13:12,395
Why did you want to kill yourself?

158
00:13:12,495 --> 00:13:14,994
<i>No, don't answer the question, Frank.</i>

159
00:13:15,104 --> 00:13:17,534
<i>- Richard! Richard!
- He's not gonna answer the question. Frank.</i>

160
00:13:17,634 --> 00:13:20,074
- I wanted to kill myself-
- Don't listen to him.

161
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,304
<i>- I was very unhappy.
- He's sick in his head.</i>

162
00:13:22,404 --> 00:13:24,804
- Richard!
- I'm sorry! I don't think it's an appropriate conversation...

163
00:13:24,914 --> 00:13:27,074
- for a seven-year-old.
- She's gonna find out anyway.

164
00:13:27,184 --> 00:13:31,084
- Okay.
- Go on, Frank.

165
00:13:34,284 --> 00:13:36,514
Why were you unhappy?

166
00:13:36,624 --> 00:13:40,084
Um, well, there are a lot of reasons.

167
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:45,103
Mainly, though, I fell in love
with someone who didn't love me back.

168
00:13:45,203 --> 00:13:46,763
Who?

169
00:13:46,873 --> 00:13:50,103
<i>One of my grad students.
I was very much in love with him.</i>

170
00:13:50,213 --> 00:13:52,583
Him?

171
00:13:52,683 --> 00:13:57,013
<i>It was a boy?
You fell in love with a boy?</i>

172
00:13:57,123 --> 00:14:00,243
- Yes, I did. Very much so.
- That's silly.

173
00:14:00,353 --> 00:14:03,053
<i>You're right. It was silly.
It was very, very silly.</i>

174
00:14:03,163 --> 00:14:06,223
- There's another word for it.
- Dad.

175
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:10,233
<i>- So, that's when you tried to kill yourself?
- Well, no.</i>

176
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:13,892
The boy that I was in love with fell in love
with another man- Larry Sugarman.

177
00:14:14,002 --> 00:14:16,262
- Who's Larry Sugarman?
- Larry Sugarman is, perhaps...

178
00:14:16,372 --> 00:14:19,532
the second most highly regarded
Proust scholar in the U.S.

179
00:14:19,642 --> 00:14:23,202
- Who's number one?
- That would be me, Rich.

180
00:14:23,312 --> 00:14:25,712
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

181
00:14:25,812 --> 00:14:27,942
So that's when.

182
00:14:28,052 --> 00:14:30,412
No. What happened was
I was a bit upset...

183
00:14:30,522 --> 00:14:32,812
so I said some things
that I shouldn't have said...

184
00:14:32,922 --> 00:14:35,052
<i>and I did some things
that I shouldn't have done...</i>

185
00:14:35,152 --> 00:14:37,212
and subsequently
I was fired from my job...

186
00:14:37,322 --> 00:14:40,491
<i>and forced to move out of my apartment
and move into a motel.</i>

187
00:14:44,261 --> 00:14:46,751
<i>- And that's when you tried to-
- Well, no.</i>

188
00:14:46,871 --> 00:14:49,061
Actually, all of that was okay.

189
00:14:49,171 --> 00:14:53,761
What happened was two days ago the
MacArthur Foundation, in its infinite wisdom...

190
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:58,071
<i>awarded a genius grant
to Larry Sugarman.</i>

191
00:14:58,181 --> 00:15:00,441
And that's when I-

192
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:03,141
<i>Decided to check out early.</i>

193
00:15:03,251 --> 00:15:06,811
Yes. Yes. And I failed
at that as well.

194
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:10,910
<i>Olive, the important thing
to understand here...</i>

195
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,250
<i>is that Uncle Frank
gave up on himself.</i>

196
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,290
He made a series of foolish choices-
I'm sorry- and he gave up on himself...

197
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,960
which is something winners never do.
