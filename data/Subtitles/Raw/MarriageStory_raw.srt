2042
01:37:24,296 --> 01:37:26,340
You're being so much like your father.

2043
01:37:26,841 --> 01:37:28,258
Do not compare me to my father!

2044
01:37:28,342 --> 01:37:30,760
I didn't compare you to him.
I said you were acting like him.

2045
01:37:30,845 --> 01:37:32,096
You're exactly like your mother.

2046
01:37:32,179 --> 01:37:35,307
Everything you were complaining about her,
you're doing. You're suffocating Henry.

2047
01:37:35,390 --> 01:37:38,102
First of all, I love my mother.
She was a wonderful mother.

2048
01:37:38,185 --> 01:37:40,520
- I'm just repeating what you told me.
- Secondly, how dare you

2049
01:37:40,604 --> 01:37:42,439
compare my mothering to my mother!

2050
01:37:42,522 --> 01:37:45,484
I may be like my father,
but I am not like my mother!

2051
01:37:45,567 --> 01:37:46,568
You are!

2052
01:37:46,651 --> 01:37:48,195
And you're like my father!

2053
01:37:48,278 --> 01:37:49,696
You're also like my mother!

2054
01:37:49,780 --> 01:37:51,991
You're all the bad things
about all of these people!

2055
01:37:52,491 --> 01:37:53,575
But mostly your mother.

2056
01:37:53,658 --> 01:37:54,993
When we would lie in bed together,

2057
01:37:55,077 --> 01:37:57,913
sometimes I would look at you and see her
and just feel so gross!

2058
01:37:57,997 --> 01:38:00,708
- I felt repulsed when you touched me!
- You're a slob.

2059
01:38:00,791 --> 01:38:02,418
I made all the beds,
closed all cabinets...

2060
01:38:02,501 --> 01:38:05,795
The thought of having sex with you
makes me want toÂ peel my skin off.

2061
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:08,215
You'll never be happy, in LA or anywhere.

2062
01:38:08,298 --> 01:38:10,800
You'll think you found
some better opposite guy than me,

2063
01:38:10,885 --> 01:38:13,262
and in a few years,
you'll rebel against him

2064
01:38:13,345 --> 01:38:16,473
because you need to have your voice,
but you don't want a voice.

2065
01:38:16,556 --> 01:38:18,850
You just want to fucking complain
about not having a voice!

2066
01:38:18,934 --> 01:38:22,187
I think about being married to you,
and that woman is a stranger to me.

2067
01:38:22,729 --> 01:38:25,189
- I mean, we had a child's marriage.
- You've regressed.

2068
01:38:25,274 --> 01:38:27,902
You've gone back to your life
before you met me, it's pathetic.

2069
01:38:27,985 --> 01:38:31,864
People used to tell me that you were
too selfish to be a great artist.

2070
01:38:31,947 --> 01:38:33,658
And I used to defend you.

2071
01:38:33,740 --> 01:38:35,116
They were absolutely right.

2072
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:37,912
All your best acting is behind you.
You're back to being a hack!

2073
01:38:37,995 --> 01:38:41,165
You gaslighted me!
You're a fucking villain!

2074
01:38:41,248 --> 01:38:44,709
You want to present yourself as a victim
because it's a good legal strategy?

2075
01:38:44,793 --> 01:38:47,879
Fine, but you and I both know
you chose this life!

2076
01:38:48,422 --> 01:38:50,299
You wanted it until you didn't!

2077
01:38:51,341 --> 01:38:53,593
You used me so you could get out of LA.

2078
01:38:53,677 --> 01:38:54,719
I didn't use you.

2079
01:38:54,803 --> 01:38:57,138
You did, and then you blamed me for it!

2080
01:38:57,306 --> 01:38:59,724
You always made me aware
of what I was doing wrong,

2081
01:38:59,808 --> 01:39:01,100
how I was falling short!

2082
01:39:01,185 --> 01:39:02,895
Life with you was joyless!

2083
01:39:02,978 --> 01:39:05,523
What, so then you had to go
and fuck someone else?

2084
01:39:05,605 --> 01:39:07,191
You shouldn't be upset that I fucked her!

2085
01:39:07,274 --> 01:39:09,151
You should be upset
that I had a laugh with her!

2086
01:39:09,234 --> 01:39:10,069
Do you love her?

2087
01:39:10,152 --> 01:39:11,403
No.

2088
01:39:11,486 --> 01:39:13,947
But she didn't hate me. You hated me.

2089
01:39:14,031 --> 01:39:15,115
You hated me.

2090
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:16,909
You fucked somebody we worked with.

2091
01:39:16,992 --> 01:39:19,494
You stopped having sex with me
in the last year.

2092
01:39:19,578 --> 01:39:21,079
I never cheated on you.

2093
01:39:21,163 --> 01:39:22,247
That was cheating on me!

2094
01:39:22,331 --> 01:39:24,291
But there was so much I could have done.

2095
01:39:24,374 --> 01:39:27,002
I was a director in my twenties
who came from nothing

2096
01:39:27,086 --> 01:39:30,255
and was suddenly on the cover
of fucking <i>Time Out New York!</i>

2097
01:39:30,339 --> 01:39:33,300
I was hot shit and I wanted
to fuck everybody and I didn't.

2098
01:39:33,383 --> 01:39:35,635
And I loved you
and I didn't want to lose you.

2099
01:39:35,719 --> 01:39:38,555
But I'm in my twenties,
and I didn't want to lose that too,

2100
01:39:38,638 --> 01:39:40,182
and I kinda did!

2101
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:43,017
And you wanted so much so fast.

2102
01:39:43,102 --> 01:39:44,812
I didn't even want to get married.

2103
01:39:44,895 --> 01:39:46,481
And fuck it!

2104
01:39:46,813 --> 01:39:48,523
There's so much I didn't do.

2105
01:39:48,607 --> 01:39:51,276
- Thanks for that!
- You're welcome!

2106
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:54,529
I can't believe
I have to know you forever!

2107
01:39:54,613 --> 01:39:56,698
You're fucking insane!

2108
01:39:57,491 --> 01:39:59,701
And you're fucking winning!

2109
01:40:00,327 --> 01:40:01,912
Are you kidding me?

2110
01:40:02,287 --> 01:40:04,123
I wanted to be married.

2111
01:40:04,664 --> 01:40:05,999
I'd already lost!

2112
01:40:06,458 --> 01:40:08,793
You didn't love me as much as I loved you!

2113
01:40:10,670 --> 01:40:12,339
What does that have to do with LA?

2114
01:40:14,674 --> 01:40:15,509
What?

2115
01:40:15,592 --> 01:40:19,012
You're so merged
with your own selfishness,

2116
01:40:19,096 --> 01:40:22,224
you don't even identify it
as selfishness anymore!

2117
01:40:22,599 --> 01:40:24,851
You're such a dick!

2118
01:40:24,935 --> 01:40:27,563
Every day I wake up
and I hope you're dead!

2119
01:40:27,646 --> 01:40:30,690
Dead, like if I could guarantee
Henry would be okay,

2120
01:40:30,774 --> 01:40:34,611
I'd hope you'd get an illness,
and then get hit by a car and die!

2121
01:40:54,381 --> 01:40:56,425
Oh, God!

2122
01:41:06,393 --> 01:41:07,227
I'm sorry.

2123
01:41:09,146 --> 01:41:10,105
Me too.
