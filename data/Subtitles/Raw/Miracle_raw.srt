1176
01:38:19,810 --> 01:38:21,895
Great moments...

1177
01:38:23,564 --> 01:38:26,482
...are born from great opportunity.

1178
01:38:28,652 --> 01:38:31,154
That's what you have here tonight, boys.

1179
01:38:33,490 --> 01:38:37,118
That's what you've earned here tonight.

1180
01:38:41,415 --> 01:38:42,790
One game.

1181
01:38:44,501 --> 01:38:48,504
If we played them ten times,
they might win nine.

1182
01:38:50,382 --> 01:38:52,383
But not this game.

1183
01:38:53,802 --> 01:38:55,470
Not tonight.

1184
01:38:58,223 --> 01:39:01,309
Tonight we skate with them.

1185
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:05,605
Tonight we stay with them.

1186
01:39:05,689 --> 01:39:09,359
And we shut them down because we can.

1187
01:39:15,324 --> 01:39:20,912
Tonight we are
the greatest hockey team in the world.

1188
01:39:27,628 --> 01:39:30,505
You were born to be hockey players.

1189
01:39:31,507 --> 01:39:33,508
Every one of you.

1190
01:39:36,261 --> 01:39:39,889
And you were meant to be here tonight.

1191
01:39:44,478 --> 01:39:46,646
This is your time.

1192
01:39:50,818 --> 01:39:53,945
Their time is done.

1193
01:39:54,029 --> 01:39:56,030
It's over.

1194
01:39:57,074 --> 01:40:03,079
I'm sick and tired of hearing about what
a great hockey team the Soviets have.

1195
01:40:03,163 --> 01:40:07,041
Screw them. This is your time.

1196
01:40:09,169 --> 01:40:11,963
Now, go out there and take it.

1197
01:41:27,790 --> 01:41:30,833
Hold up here a second.
We're just gonna wait for the OK.

1198
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:36,005
- We're all set.
- All right. Go ahead and send them in.

1199
01:41:36,090 --> 01:41:38,299
OK. It's time.

1200
01:41:38,342 --> 01:41:40,009
Come on, Jimmy.

1201
01:41:40,094 --> 01:41:44,305
Come on, Buzzy. Let's hustle.

1202
01:41:47,976 --> 01:41:50,019
Come on, Brotz. Let's go, Strobel.

1203
01:41:52,689 --> 01:41:54,357
Rizzo.

1204
01:41:56,443 --> 01:42:00,613
USA! USA! USA!
