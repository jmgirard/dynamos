153
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,848
Come on, man.

154
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,709
Give me your head.

155
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:10,381
Here, let your head
rest in my hand. Relax.

156
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:13,934
I got you, I promise.
I'm not gon' let you go.

157
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,058
Hey, man, I got you.

158
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:19,107
There you go.
Ten seconds.

159
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,943
Feel that right there?

160
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,731
You're in the middle
of the world, man.

161
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,192
That's good.

162
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,946
Do like this.

163
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:39,077
Look at you.

164
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,707
More athletic.

165
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,960
There you go...
there you go.

166
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,711
Yeah.
I think you ready.

167
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,463
I think we got a swimmer.

168
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,512
You wanna try?
You ready to swim?

169
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,344
Go.

170
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:04,060
Yeah, man!

171
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:07,609
Yeah!

172
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,261
<i>Let me tell you something, man.</i>

173
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,305
<i>There are black people
everywhere.</i>

174
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,096
<i>Remember that, okay?</i>

175
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,154
<i>No place you can go in the world
ain't got no black people.</i>

176
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,055
<i>We's the first on this planet.</i>

177
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,936
I been here a long time.

178
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,023
But I'm from Cuba.

179
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,655
Lot a black folks in Cuba,

180
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,574
you wouldn't know that
from being here, though.

181
00:19:56,737 --> 00:20:00,332
I was a wild li'l shorty, man,
just like you.

182
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:03,878
Runnin' around with no shoes on
when the moon was out.

183
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,373
This one time...

184
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:12,091
I run by this old...
this old lady.

185
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:16,265
I was runnin', hollerin'...
cuttin' a fool, boy.

186
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:20,432
This old lady, she stopped me.

187
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:21,854
She said...

188
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,486
"Running around,
catching up all that light.

189
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:34,318
In moonlight...
black boys look blue.

190
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,244
You blue.

191
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,115
That's what I gon' call you.

192
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:43,868
Blue."

193
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,960
So your name Blue?

194
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,877
Nah.

195
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,436
At some point you gotta decide
for yourself who you gon' be.

196
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,520
Can't let nobody make
that decision for you.
