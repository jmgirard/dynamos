96
00:20:59,446 --> 00:21:00,286
How much?

97
00:21:00,486 --> 00:21:01,966
Sixty-nine cents.

98
00:21:02,366 --> 00:21:03,566
And the gas.

99
00:21:04,446 --> 00:21:06,526
Y'all getting any rain up your way?

100
00:21:08,165 --> 00:21:09,165
What way would that be?

101
00:21:09,245 --> 00:21:10,885
I seen you was from Dallas.

102
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:19,005
What business is it of yours
where I'm from, friendo?

103
00:21:21,765 --> 00:21:23,165
I didn't mean nothing by it.

104
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,685
Didn't mean nothing.

105
00:21:24,885 --> 00:21:27,165
Just passing my time.

106
00:21:29,525 --> 00:21:32,805
If you don't wanna accept that I
don't know what else I can do for you.

107
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,405
Will there be something else?

108
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,765
I don't know. Will there?

109
00:21:45,964 --> 00:21:47,004
Is something wrong?

110
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:47,781
With what?

111
00:21:47,816 --> 00:21:48,524
With anything?

112
00:21:50,324 --> 00:21:51,564
Is that what you're asking me?

113
00:21:52,404 --> 00:21:54,124
Is there something wrong with anything?

114
00:21:55,004 --> 00:21:56,084
Will there be anything else?

115
00:21:56,124 --> 00:21:57,164
You already asked me that.

116
00:22:01,444 --> 00:22:03,364
Well... I need to see about closing.

117
00:22:03,804 --> 00:22:05,044
See about closing.

118
00:22:05,164 --> 00:22:05,609
Yes sir.

119
00:22:05,644 --> 00:22:06,724
What time do you close?

120
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:07,961
Now. We close now.

121
00:22:07,996 --> 00:22:09,129
Now is not a time.

122
00:22:09,164 --> 00:22:10,364
What time do you close?

123
00:22:10,404 --> 00:22:12,124
Generally around dark. At dark.

124
00:22:17,164 --> 00:22:18,963
You don't know what you're
talking about, do you?

125
00:22:18,998 --> 00:22:19,563
Sir?

126
00:22:21,803 --> 00:22:24,563
I said you don't know
what you're talking about.

127
00:22:27,643 --> 00:22:28,843
What time do you go to bed?

128
00:22:29,523 --> 00:22:30,043
Sir?

129
00:22:30,243 --> 00:22:31,963
You're a bit deaf, aren't you?

130
00:22:31,998 --> 00:22:33,683
I said what time do you go to bed?

131
00:22:38,283 --> 00:22:39,683
Somewhere around 9:30.

132
00:22:40,283 --> 00:22:41,863
I'd say around 9:30.

133
00:22:41,898 --> 00:22:43,408
I could come back then.

134
00:22:43,443 --> 00:22:44,763
Why would you be coming back?

135
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:45,728
We'd be closed.

136
00:22:45,763 --> 00:22:46,763
Yeah. You said that.

137
00:22:49,123 --> 00:22:50,768
Well... I got to close now.

138
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:52,363
You live in that house out back?

139
00:22:53,643 --> 00:22:55,482
Yes I do.

140
00:22:56,362 --> 00:22:57,802
You lived here all your life?

141
00:22:59,322 --> 00:23:03,202
This is my wife's father's place. Originally.

142
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:06,922
You married into it.

143
00:23:07,642 --> 00:23:10,282
We lived in Temple Texas for many years.

144
00:23:11,762 --> 00:23:13,202
Raised a family there.

145
00:23:14,002 --> 00:23:15,207
In Temple.

146
00:23:15,242 --> 00:23:17,362
We come out here about four years ago.

147
00:23:18,322 --> 00:23:19,202
You married into it.

148
00:23:20,002 --> 00:23:21,482
If that's the way you wanna put it.

149
00:23:21,762 --> 00:23:23,442
I don't have some way to put it.

150
00:23:24,562 --> 00:23:25,642
That's the way it is.

151
00:23:34,001 --> 00:23:36,401
What's the most you've
ever lost in a coin toss?

152
00:23:37,761 --> 00:23:38,246
Sir?

153
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:41,601
The most you ever lost in a coin toss.

154
00:23:43,761 --> 00:23:45,361
I don't know. I couldn't say.

155
00:23:48,481 --> 00:23:49,321
Call it.

156
00:23:50,081 --> 00:23:50,561
Call it?

157
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:51,201
Yes.

158
00:23:51,841 --> 00:23:52,521
For what?

159
00:23:52,761 --> 00:23:53,561
Just call it.

160
00:23:56,681 --> 00:24:00,361
Well, we need to know what
we're calling it for here.

161
00:24:00,396 --> 00:24:01,401
You need to call it.

162
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,161
I can't call it for you.

163
00:24:04,001 --> 00:24:05,240
It wouldn't be fair.

164
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,920
I didn't put nothing up.

165
00:24:06,955 --> 00:24:08,200
Yes, you did.

166
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,520
You've been putting it up your whole life.

167
00:24:10,555 --> 00:24:11,600
You just didn't know it.

168
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,760
You know what date is on this coin?

169
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,000
No.

170
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,960
1958.

171
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,080
It's been traveling
twenty-two years to get here.

172
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,560
And now it's here.

173
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,920
And it's either heads or tails.

174
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,680
And you have to say. Call it.

175
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,040
Look... I need to know what I stand to win.

176
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,200
Everything.

177
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,045
How's that?

178
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,240
You stand to win everything. Call it.

179
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,159
Alright. Heads then.

180
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:48,839
Well done.

181
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,159
Don't put it in your pocket.

182
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:53,164
Sir?

183
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:55,239
Don't put it in your pocket.
It's your lucky quarter.

184
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:58,639
Where you want me to put it?

185
00:24:58,674 --> 00:24:59,759
Anywhere not in your pocket.

186
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:04,079
Or it'll be mixed in with the
others and become just a coin.

187
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:09,119
Which it is.
