533
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,371
Thanks.

534
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,461
Oh, gosh. It's him.

535
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,463
Hey, Hal!

536
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:29,720
Welcome home, kiddo.

537
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:37,896
- Get into these arms, you little punk.
- Dad.

538
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:39,810
Finally.

539
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:49,654
Oh, I hope you had a lousy time at that
camp because you are not going back.

540
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,446
I missed you too much.

541
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:54,746
What happened to you, Hal?

542
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:57,165
Something's changed.

543
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,413
Are you getting taller?

544
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,842
So, what's up, Dad?

545
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:06,173
I mean, how's Chessy and everybody?

546
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:09,306
Great. Everybody's great.
Can't wait to see you.

547
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:13,553
Eight weeks really is too long, Hal.
A lot's been happening around here.

548
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,971
A lot's happened to me too, Dad.

549
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:19,391
I mean, I feel like
I'm practically a new woman.

550
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:23,354
What's the matter? I cut myself shaving?

551
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:27,775
No, it's just... just seeing you
for the first time.

552
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:30,990
I mean, you know... in so long.

553
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,955
You look taller to me too, Dad.

554
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:36,037
Come on, squirt. Let's get home.

555
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:53,767
<i>Oh, by the way,
thanks for all those newsy letters.</i>

556
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:56,644
I'm really glad I bought you
all that personalized stationery

557
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,305
you just had to have.

558
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,395
- We meant to write, Dad, but we just...
- "We?"

559
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:05,859
Oh, me and my friend. I met this girl
at camp and we got really close.

560
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:07,068
Great.

561
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,815
Practically like sisters.

562
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,243
- She was a lovely girl.
- "Lovely girl?"

563
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:15,205
What, all of a sudden you're so proper?

564
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:19,501
- Still biting those nails, I see.
- Dad, you noticed!

565
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:23,254
What do you mean, "noticed?" You've
been biting them since you could chew.

566
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:26,417
But I've decided to stop, Dad.
It's a horrid habit.

567
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:28,547
"Lovely girl," "horrid habit."

568
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:31,759
What did I do, send you
to summer camp or finishing school?

569
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,766
And why do you keep saying "Dad"
at the end of every sentence?

570
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,928
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
I was doing it, Dad.

571
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,639
Sorry, Dad.

572
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:46,065
Do you want to know
why I keep saying "Dad?" The truth?

573
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:48,946
'Cause you missed
your old man so much, right?

574
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:51,116
Exactly.

575
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:56,451
It's because in my whole life - I mean,
you know, for the past eight weeks -

576
00:47:56,624 --> 00:48:00,743
I was never able to say the word "Dad."
Never. Not once.

577
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:03,082
And if you ask me,

578
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:06,214
a dad is an irreplaceable person
in a girl's life.

579
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:10,548
Think about it. There's a whole day
devoted to celebrating fathers.

580
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,384
Just imagine someone's life
without a father.

581
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,549
Never buying a Father's Day card.

582
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,718
Never sitting on their father's lap.

583
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,477
Never being able to say, "Hi, Dad!"

584
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:22,606
or, "What's up, Dad?"
or, "Catch you later, Dad."

585
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:25,643
I mean, a baby's first words
are always "Dada," aren't they?

586
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:30,064
Let me see if I get this.
You missed being able to call me "Dad?"

587
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:33,325
Yeah. I really have, Dad.

588
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:43,163
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

589
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:45,875
Now you're starting
to sound like your old self.

590
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,690
Hello, gorgeous!

591
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:15,029
Oh, look at you!

592
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:17,364
Oh, you grew.

593
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:21,373
Oh, we missed you so much.

594
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:25,077
Hey. Don't you dare let your old man
talk you out of going back to camp, OK?

595
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:26,707
You're a growing girl. You need adventure.

596
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:29,165
- OK.
- You hungry?

597
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:31,883
I made corn bread and chili.

598
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,510
- Why are you so quiet? What's wrong?
- Nothing.

599
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,637
It's just I'm so happy to be home.

600
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:39,720
Hey, did I hear something
about corn bread and chili?

601
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,393
Yeah, it's on the stove. So...

602
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:47,103
Something's changed about you, Hal.
Hm. I can't put my finger on it,

603
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:49,984
but something about you
has definitely changed.

604
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:53,989
Really? Well, it's just the same old me.

605
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:57,112
Honest.

606
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,737
Hi, Sammy!

607
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:06,209
What is wrong with you, you goofball?
It's Hallie.

608
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:09,496
Oh, I probably just
smell like camp, that's all.

609
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:14,798
What's the matter with you?
It's like you didn't even recognize her.

610
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:23,055
Wow, it's even better than the pictures.

611
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:28,811
OK, kiddo.
What do you want to do first, huh?

612
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:34,025
You want to eat and then unpack,
or we could unpack and then eat.

613
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:36,986
Or we could eat while we unpack.

614
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,242
You mean I can eat in my room?

615
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:42,320
Yeah, it's a definite possibility.

616
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:46,037
Hey, Hal. When you're done, come on
down. There's someone I want you to meet.

617
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,956
- OK, Dad.
- OK, Hal.

618
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:55,417
Look at you, always eating.

619
00:50:57,638 --> 00:50:59,800
- Did you tell her?
- No.

620
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:01,260
Oh, Nicky.

621
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,091
Tell me what?

622
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:08,430
Hal, it is none of my business how your
father makes a fool out of himself, OK?

623
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:13,193
- He's a big boy. He can do what he wants.
- OK, OK. So, who is she?

624
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:19,817
Her name's Meredith Blake.
She's a publicist from San Francisco.

625
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:21,986
Your father hired her
at the beginning of the summer

626
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:24,028
to do some publicity for the vineyard.

627
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:28,246
If you ask me, she's doing a better job
of selling herself than the grapes.

628
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:31,628
What do you mean?

629
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:36,507
Look, you and I both know your father's
not some kind of suave, debonair,

630
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:38,009
bachelor-of-the-month type.

631
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:41,637
So I gotta ask myself,
what does a hot young thing like that

632
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:44,515
see in a guy who walks around
with his shirttail hanging out

633
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:46,176
and a cereal bowl full of chili.

634
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:51,147
Then I realized there's about a million
reasons why that girl's giggling.

635
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,978
All of them are sitting
at the Napa Valley Community Bank.

636
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:58,654
You mean, you don't think
she even really likes him?

637
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,907
Ah, what do I know?
But I tell you one thing,

638
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:03,568
this one's got your father
eating out of the palm of her hand.

639
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:07,497
They do everything together.
They ride together, they swim together.

640
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,658
They go out to eat dinner every night.

641
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:14,000
Do you know what? Meet her. See
for yourself. Don't let me influence you.
