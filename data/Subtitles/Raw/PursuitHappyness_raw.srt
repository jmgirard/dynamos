287
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:26,074
- Taxi!
- Mr. Twistle.

288
00:24:26,283 --> 00:24:28,952
- Yeah, hi.
- Hi. Chris Gardner.

289
00:24:29,202 --> 00:24:30,996
Yeah, hi. Listen.
What can I do for you?

290
00:24:31,204 --> 00:24:34,249
I submitted an application for the
intern programme about a month ago...

291
00:24:34,457 --> 00:24:36,710
...and I would just love
to sit with you briefly...

292
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,878
Listen, I'm going
to Noe Valley, Chris.

293
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:42,382
- Take care of yourself.
- Mr. Twistle.

294
00:24:42,632 --> 00:24:44,926
Actually, I'm on my way
to Noe Valley also.

295
00:24:45,135 --> 00:24:46,886
How about we share a ride?

296
00:24:48,388 --> 00:24:50,557
- All right, get in.
- All right.

297
00:24:56,646 --> 00:24:59,399
So when I was in the Navy,
I worked for a doctor...

298
00:24:59,649 --> 00:25:02,444
...who loved to play golf,
hours every day...

299
00:25:02,652 --> 00:25:07,282
...and I would actually
perform medical procedures...

300
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:09,034
...when he'd leave me in the office.

301
00:25:09,242 --> 00:25:14,497
So I'm used to being in a position
where I have to make decisions and...

302
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:18,793
Mr. Twistle, listen.
This is a very important...

303
00:25:19,002 --> 00:25:21,212
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
This thing's impossible.

304
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,425
- I can do it.
- No, you can't. No one can.

305
00:25:25,675 --> 00:25:28,345
- That's bullshit.
- No, I'm pretty sure I can do it.

306
00:25:28,762 --> 00:25:31,932
- No, you can't.
- Let me see it.

307
00:25:32,515 --> 00:25:33,725
Give it here.

308
00:25:36,686 --> 00:25:40,982
Oh, yeah. Oh, wow,
you really messed it up.

309
00:25:41,191 --> 00:25:42,734
Sorry.

310
00:25:43,276 --> 00:25:49,241
It looks like it works around a swivel,
so the centre pieces never move.

311
00:25:49,449 --> 00:25:52,535
So if it's yellow in the centre,
that's the yellow side.

312
00:25:52,786 --> 00:25:55,247
If it's red in the centre,
that's the red side.

313
00:25:55,455 --> 00:25:59,084
- Okay.
- So... You can slow down.

314
00:25:59,292 --> 00:26:02,337
Listen, we can drive around all day.
I don't believe you can do this.

315
00:26:02,545 --> 00:26:04,256
- Yeah, I can.
- No, you can't.

316
00:26:04,464 --> 00:26:05,632
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.

317
00:26:05,882 --> 00:26:07,759
I'm telling you, no one can.

318
00:26:09,719 --> 00:26:11,930
See? That's all I ever do.

319
00:26:24,818 --> 00:26:27,112
You almost have this side.

320
00:26:27,737 --> 00:26:29,197
Holy cow.

321
00:26:39,416 --> 00:26:43,211
- You almost had that one.
- I'm gonna get it.

322
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,512
Look at that.

323
00:27:15,785 --> 00:27:16,995
You're almost there.

324
00:27:40,727 --> 00:27:44,439
- 1710.
- This is me.

325
00:27:46,566 --> 00:27:47,943
Good job.

326
00:27:49,819 --> 00:27:52,906
- Goodbye.
- Yeah. I'll see you soon.

327
00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:57,035
Where are you going, sir?

328
00:27:57,244 --> 00:28:00,247
Excuse me, sir.
Where are you going, please?

329
00:28:03,583 --> 00:28:05,293
Two... A couple of blocks.

330
00:28:05,502 --> 00:28:08,922
- Just flip around.
- Okay.
