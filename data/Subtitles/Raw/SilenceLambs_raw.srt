152
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,113
You use Evyan skin cream.

153
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,618
And sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps,

154
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,538
but not today.

155
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,251
Did you do all these drawings, Doctor?

156
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:44,007
That is the Duomo,
seen from the Belvedere.

157
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,135
You know Florence?

158
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,471
All that detail just from memory, sir?

159
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:54,434
Memory, Agent Starling,
is what I have instead of a view.

160
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,643
Well,

161
00:14:55,728 --> 00:15:00,565
perhaps you'd care to lend us your view
on this questionnaire, sir.

162
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,984
Oh, no, no, no.

163
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,111
You were doing fine.

164
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,323
You had been courteous
and receptive to courtesy.

165
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:12,994
You had established trust
with the embarrassing truth about Miggs.

166
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:17,248
And now this ham-handed segue
into your questionnaire.

167
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,335
It won't do.

168
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,629
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor.

169
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,797
Either you will or you won't.

170
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,924
Yeah.

171
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,676
Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed,

172
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,596
if he is recruiting help
from the student body.

173
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,515
Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill.

174
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,684
What a naughty boy he is.

175
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:40,605
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill?

176
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,858
Please tell me. The newspapers won't say.

177
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,779
Well, it started as a bad joke
in Kansas City Homicide.

178
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:51,616
They said,
"This one likes to skin his humps."

179
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:57,121
Why do you think he removes their skins,

180
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,706
Agent Starling?

181
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,959
Enthrall me with your acumen.

182
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,252
It excites him.

183
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:07,340
Most serial killers keep
some sort of trophies from their victims.

184
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,716
I didn't.

185
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,926
No.

186
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,678
No, you ate yours.

187
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,265
You send that through now.

188
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,335
Oh, Agent Starling,

189
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,922
you think you can dissect me
with this blunt, little tool?

190
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:49,507
No.

191
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,467
I thought that your knowledge...

192
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,803
You're so ambitious, aren't you?

193
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,430
You know what you look like to me

194
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,932
with your good bag and your cheap shoes?

195
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,767
You look like a rube.

196
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:04,230
A well-scrubbed, hustling rube
with a little taste.

197
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,442
Good nutrition has given you
some length of bone,

198
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,862
but you're not more than one generation
from poor white trash,

199
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,864
are you, Agent Starling?

200
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,783
And that accent you've tried
so desperately to shed,

201
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,535
pure West Virginia.

202
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,413
What does your father do?
Is he a coal miner?

203
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,498
Does he stink of the lamp?

204
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,209
And, oh, how quickly the boys found you.

205
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,838
All those tedious, sticky fumblings
in the back seats of cars,

206
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:32,675
while you could only dream
of getting out, getting anywhere,

207
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,471
getting all the way to the FBI.

208
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,642
You see a lot, Doctor.

209
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:47,523
But are you strong enough to point
that high-powered perception at yourself?

210
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,068
What about it? Why don't you...

211
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,738
Why don't you look at yourself
and write down what you see?

212
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,407
Maybe you're afraid to.

213
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,795
A census-taker once tried to test me.

214
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:12,548
I ate his liver with some fava beans,

215
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,675
and a nice Chianti.

216
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,395
You fly back to school now, little Starling.

217
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,564
Fly, fly, fly.

218
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:47,375
I bit my wrist so I could die.
