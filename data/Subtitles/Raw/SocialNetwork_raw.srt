6
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,440
How do you distinguish yourself
in a population of people

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,360
who all got 1600 on their SATs?

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,240
- I didn't know they take SATs in China.
- They don't.

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,450
I wasn't talking about China anymore,
I was talking about me.

10
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:36,990
You got a 1600?

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,910
Yes. I could sing in an a Capella group,
but I can't sing.

12
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,200
Does that mean you actually
got nothing wrong?

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,580
I could row crew or invent a $25 PC.

14
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,910
Or you could get into a final club.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,330
Or I get into a final club.

16
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,830
You know, from a woman's perspective,

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,790
sometimes not singing in
an a Capella group is a good thing.

18
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,920
This is serious.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,460
On the other hand,
I do like guys who row crew.

20
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,420
Well, I can't do that.

21
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,090
I was kidding.

22
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,340
And, yes, I got nothing wrong on the test.

23
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,220
- Have you ever tried?
- I'm trying right now.

24
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,140
- To row crew?
- To get into a final club.

25
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,470
To row crew? No.
Are you, like, whatever, delusional?

26
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,520
Maybe it's just sometimes
you say two things at once.

27
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,140
I'm not sure which one
I'm supposed to be aiming at.

28
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,150
But you've seen guys who row crew, right?

29
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,270
No.

30
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,440
Okay, well, they're bigger than me.
They're world-class athletes.

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,980
And a second ago,
you said you like guys who row crew

32
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,110
so I assumed you had met one.

33
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,200
I guess I just meant I like the idea of it.
You know, the way a girl likes cowboys.

34
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,780
Okay.

35
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,330
Should we get something to eat?

36
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,200
Would you like to talk
about something else?

37
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,710
No. It's just since the beginning of
the conversation about finals club,

38
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,670
I think I may have missed a birthday.

39
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,630
There are really more people in China with
genius IQs than the entire population...

40
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:36,050
The Phoenix is the most diverse.
The Fly Club... Roosevelt punched the Porc.

41
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,220
Which one?

42
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,800
The Porcellian, the Porc.
It's the best of the best.

43
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,640
- Which Roosevelt?
- Theodore.

44
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,060
Is it true that they send a bus around
to pick up girls

45
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,600
who want to party with
the next Fed chairman?

46
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,390
So you can see why
it's so important to get in.

47
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,020
Okay, well, which is the easiest to get into?

48
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,400
- Why would you ask me that?
- I was just asking.

49
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,650
None of them. That's the point.

50
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,660
My friend Eduardo made $300,000
betting oil futures one summer

51
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,070
and Eduardo won't come close to getting in.

52
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,120
The ability to make money doesn't
impress anybody around here.

53
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,450
Must be nice.
He made $300,000 in a summer?

54
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,870
- He likes meteorology.
- You said it was oil futures.

55
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,170
You can read the weather,
you can predict the price of heating oil.

56
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,340
I think you asked me that

57
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,210
because you think
the final club that's easiest to get into

58
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,550
is the one where I'll have the best chance.

59
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,970
I... What?

60
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,590
You asked me which one was
the easiest to get into

61
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,180
because you think that that's the one
where I'll have the best chance.

62
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,760
The one that's the easiest to get into
would be the one

63
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,020
where anybody has the best chance.

64
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,680
You didn't ask me which one
was the best one,

65
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,230
you asked me which one
was the easiest one.

66
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,900
I was honestly just asking, okay?
I was just asking to ask.

67
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,360
- Mark, I'm not speaking in code.
- Erica.

68
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,780
You're obsessed with finals clubs.

69
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,240
You have finals clubs OCD
and you need to see someone about it

70
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,990
who will prescribe you
some sort of medication.

71
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,580
You don't care if the side effects
may include blindness.

72
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,370
Final clubs. Not "finals clubs."

73
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,170
And there's a difference between
being obsessed and being motivated.

74
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,090
Yes. There is.

75
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,840
Well, you do.
That was cryptic, so you do speak in code.

76
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,170
I didn't mean to be cryptic.

77
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,010
I'm just saying I need to do
something substantial

78
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,930
in order to get the attention of the clubs.

79
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,760
- Why?
- Because they're exclusive.

80
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,260
And fun, and they lead to a better life.

81
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,930
Teddy Roosevelt didn't get elected president

82
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,930
because he was a member
of the Phoenix Club.

83
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,270
He was a member of the Porcellian,
and yes, he did.

84
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,730
Well, why don't you just concentrate
on being the best you you can be?

85
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,360
Did you really just say that?

86
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,940
I was kidding.

87
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,690
Just because something's trite
doesn't make it less true.

88
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,860
I wanna try to be straightforward with you

89
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,200
and tell you I think you might
want to be a little more supportive.

90
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,870
If I get in, I will be taking you
to the events and the gatherings,

91
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,120
and you'll be meeting a lot of people
you wouldn't normally get to meet.

92
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,710
You would do that for me?

93
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,750
We're dating.

94
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,210
Okay.

95
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,460
Well, I wanna try and be
straightforward with you

96
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,380
and let you know that we're not anymore.

97
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,970
- What do you mean?
- We're not dating anymore. I'm sorry.

98
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,140
- Is this a joke?
- No, it's not.

99
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,220
You're breaking up with me?

100
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,560
You're gonna introduce me to people

101
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,310
I wouldn't normally
have the chance to meet?

102
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,230
What the... What is that supposed to mean?

103
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,560
- Wait, settle down.
- What is it supposed to mean?

104
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,480
Erica, the reason we're able to sit here
and drink right now

105
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,320
is 'cause you used to sleep
with the door guy.

106
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,070
"The door guy"? His name is Bobby.
I have not slept with the door guy.

107
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,570
The door guy is a friend of mine,
and he's a perfectly good class of people.

108
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,160
And what part of Long Island
are you from, Wimbledon?

109
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,500
- Wait. Wait, wait.
- I'm going back to my dorm.

110
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,910
- Is this real?
- Yes.

111
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
- Then wait, I apologize, okay?
- I have to go study.

112
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,420
- Erica?
- Yes?

113
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,750
- I'm sorry, I mean it.
- I appreciate that, but I have to go study.

114
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,090
Come on, you don't have to study.
Let's just talk.

115
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,420
- I can't.
- Why?

116
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,430
Because it is exhausting.
Dating you is like dating a StairMaster.

117
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,680
All I meant is that you're not likely to...
Currently...

118
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,930
I wasn't making a comment
on your appearance.

119
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,180
I was saying that you go to BU.
I was stating a fact, that's all,

120
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,350
and if it seemed rude, then I apologize.

121
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,770
- I have to go study.
- You don't have to study.

122
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,190
Why do you keep saying
I don't have to study?

123
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,110
'Cause you go to BU.

124
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,650
Do you want to get some food?

125
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,200
I am sorry you are not sufficiently
impressed with my education.

126
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,200
And I'm sorry I don't have a rowboat,
so we're even.

127
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,030
- I think we should just be friends.
- I don't want friends.

128
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,200
I was just being polite.

129
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,450
I have no intention
of being friends with you.

130
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,620
I'm under some pressure right now
from my OS class

131
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,290
and if we could just order some food,
I think we should...

132
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:02,050
Okay, you are probably going to be
a very successful computer person.

133
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,130
But you're gonna go through life
thinking that girls don't like you

134
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,880
because you're a nerd.

135
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,550
And I want you to know from the bottom
of my heart that that won't be true.

136
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,680
It'll be because you're an asshole.
