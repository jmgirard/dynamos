2288
02:16:24,740 --> 02:16:26,640
Watch your step.

2289
02:16:27,810 --> 02:16:29,710
Come in.

2290
02:16:30,910 --> 02:16:32,810
-Very nice house.
-Oh, thank you.

2291
02:16:34,110 --> 02:16:36,010
It's very rustic.

2292
02:16:36,050 --> 02:16:37,950
-Can I take your jacket?
-No, thank you, I'm fine.

2293
02:16:39,320 --> 02:16:41,320
Okay. This way, please.

2294
02:16:44,090 --> 02:16:45,930
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

2295
02:16:45,930 --> 02:16:47,830
-How about some tea?
-Oh, no, I'm all right.

2296
02:16:48,560 --> 02:16:50,460
-You sure?
-Yes.

2297
02:16:50,900 --> 02:16:52,800
I wanted to ask you about a film
that the Avenue may have played

2298
02:16:54,730 --> 02:16:56,630
while you were the organist there.

2299
02:16:56,740 --> 02:16:58,640
The Most Dangerous Game?

2300
02:16:59,110 --> 02:17:01,010
Oh, it's a classic. RKO. 1932.

2301
02:17:02,540 --> 02:17:04,440
Fay Wray, Joel McCrea, Leslie Banks.
We've run that picture many times.

2302
02:17:07,350 --> 02:17:09,250
In '68, '69?

2303
02:17:10,480 --> 02:17:12,380
I'd have to check my records. Why?

2304
02:17:12,790 --> 02:17:14,890
Do you remember the Zodiac?

2305
02:17:17,090 --> 02:17:18,990
This is about Rick Marshall, isn't it?

2306
02:17:19,460 --> 02:17:21,360
-He was a projectionist there, right?
-For a time, yes.

2307
02:17:22,960 --> 02:17:24,860
But I have no occasion
to correspond with him these days.

2308
02:17:27,100 --> 02:17:29,000
Okay. Well, there is a connection

2309
02:17:29,670 --> 02:17:31,570
between one of the Zodiac attacks
and that film.

2310
02:17:32,540 --> 02:17:34,440
You mean the symbol?

2311
02:17:35,540 --> 02:17:37,310
Hold on.

2312
02:17:37,310 --> 02:17:41,450
The Zodiac symbol on film.
It's on the countdown.

2313
02:17:45,320 --> 02:17:47,220
It's trimmed off each reel
before it's shown,

2314
02:17:48,020 --> 02:17:49,920
but it always arrives with it.

2315
02:17:50,660 --> 02:17:52,560
Right there.

2316
02:17:52,660 --> 02:17:56,370
The first time I saw it in the papers,
I thought about that.

2317
02:17:57,200 --> 02:17:58,830
We got a tip

2318
02:17:58,830 --> 02:18:00,730
that Rick left a film canister here
that he told you never to open.

2319
02:18:02,900 --> 02:18:06,040
A tip about a mysterious film canister?

2320
02:18:06,870 --> 02:18:08,770
Is it true?

2321
02:18:10,140 --> 02:18:12,010
Yes.

2322
02:18:12,010 --> 02:18:13,910
-Did you open it?
-No.

2323
02:18:14,410 --> 02:18:18,730
-May I see it?
-Rick took it back in 1972.

2324
02:18:20,420 --> 02:18:22,320
This tip is how you got it in your head
that Rick is the Zodiac?

2325
02:18:25,290 --> 02:18:27,060
That and the poster.

2326
02:18:27,060 --> 02:18:28,960
The poster?

2327
02:18:30,360 --> 02:18:32,230
The poster that Rick drew.

2328
02:18:32,230 --> 02:18:34,130
The handwriting is the closest
that we have ever come to a match.

2329
02:18:35,540 --> 02:18:37,440
-Rick didn't draw any posters.
-No, he drew this one.

2330
02:18:38,910 --> 02:18:42,380
Mr. Graysmith, I do the posters myself.

2331
02:18:43,740 --> 02:18:45,640
That's my handwriting.

2332
02:18:53,850 --> 02:18:55,750
I won't take any more of your time.

2333
02:18:56,820 --> 02:18:58,720
Why don't I just go and find out
when we played that film?

2334
02:19:02,300 --> 02:19:03,860
Oh, that's all right.

2335
02:19:03,860 --> 02:19:07,310
It's not a problem.
They're just down in the basement.

2336
02:19:09,100 --> 02:19:12,050
Not many people
have basements in California.

2337
02:19:14,710 --> 02:19:16,610
I do.

2338
02:19:17,980 --> 02:19:19,980
You coming, Mr. Graysmith?

2339
02:19:31,260 --> 02:19:34,970
The original studio one-sheets,
I always kept for myself.

2340
02:19:36,830 --> 02:19:38,730
The cheapo knock-offs
like you brought today

2341
02:19:39,470 --> 02:19:42,610
I end up tossing into the back alley.

2342
02:19:57,080 --> 02:19:58,980
'69.

2343
02:20:04,290 --> 02:20:05,620
You live alone?

2344
02:20:05,630 --> 02:20:07,530
Most Dangerous Game ran in May '69.

2345
02:20:11,500 --> 02:20:13,980
So, that would be about

2346
02:20:14,870 --> 02:20:18,180
nine weeks before
the first Zodiac letter, correct?

2347
02:20:21,070 --> 02:20:22,970
Yeah.

2348
02:20:26,650 --> 02:20:30,960
Do you think he saw the film
in our theater and was inspired?

2349
02:20:37,020 --> 02:20:39,940
Are you sure
there's nobody else in the house?

2350
02:20:41,530 --> 02:20:44,240
Would you like
to go upstairs and check?

2351
02:20:44,930 --> 02:20:46,830
No.

2352
02:20:49,070 --> 02:20:51,640
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

2353
02:20:52,470 --> 02:20:54,370
You're welcome.

2354
02:21:15,230 --> 02:21:17,130
It's locked.

2355
02:21:27,470 --> 02:21:29,370
Thank you.

2356
02:21:31,910 --> 02:21:33,950
Good night, Mr. Graysmith!
