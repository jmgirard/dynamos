1
00:00:08,111 --> 00:00:10,613
You use Evyan skin cream.

2
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:16,118
And sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps,

3
00:00:17,621 --> 00:00:19,038
but not today.

4
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,751
Did you do all these drawings, Doctor?

5
00:00:26,338 --> 00:00:29,507
That is the Duomo,
seen from the Belvedere.

6
00:00:31,093 --> 00:00:32,635
You know Florence?

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,971
All that detail just from memory, sir?

8
00:00:36,014 --> 00:00:39,934
Memory, Agent Starling,
is what I have instead of a view.

9
00:00:39,976 --> 00:00:41,143
Well,

10
00:00:41,228 --> 00:00:46,065
perhaps you'd care to lend us your view
on this questionnaire, sir.

11
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:48,484
Oh, no, no, no.

12
00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:50,611
You were doing fine.

13
00:00:50,654 --> 00:00:53,823
You had been courteous
and receptive to courtesy.

14
00:00:53,907 --> 00:00:58,494
You had established trust
with the embarrassing truth about Miggs.

15
00:00:58,578 --> 00:01:02,748
And now this ham-handed segue
into your questionnaire.

16
00:01:04,418 --> 00:01:05,835
It won't do.

17
00:01:06,169 --> 00:01:08,129
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor.

18
00:01:08,171 --> 00:01:10,297
Either you will or you won't.

19
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,424
Yeah.

20
00:01:12,092 --> 00:01:14,176
Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed,

21
00:01:14,261 --> 00:01:17,096
if he is recruiting help
from the student body.

22
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,015
Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill.

23
00:01:20,058 --> 00:01:22,184
What a naughty boy he is.

24
00:01:22,686 --> 00:01:26,105
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill?

25
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:29,358
Please tell me. The newspapers won't say.

26
00:01:30,652 --> 00:01:33,279
Well, it started as a bad joke
in Kansas City Homicide.

27
00:01:33,363 --> 00:01:37,116
They said,
"This one likes to skin his humps."

28
00:01:38,702 --> 00:01:42,621
Why do you think he removes their skins,

29
00:01:42,706 --> 00:01:44,206
Agent Starling?

30
00:01:44,249 --> 00:01:46,459
Enthrall me with your acumen.

31
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,752
It excites him.

32
00:01:49,087 --> 00:01:52,840
Most serial killers keep
some sort of trophies from their victims.

33
00:01:52,883 --> 00:01:54,216
I didn't.

34
00:01:54,301 --> 00:01:55,426
No.

35
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,178
No, you ate yours.

36
00:01:59,723 --> 00:02:01,765
You send that through now.

37
00:02:28,793 --> 00:02:29,835
Oh, Agent Starling,

38
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,422
you think you can dissect me
with this blunt, little tool?

39
00:02:33,965 --> 00:02:35,007
No.

40
00:02:35,425 --> 00:02:36,967
I thought that your knowledge...

41
00:02:37,052 --> 00:02:39,303
You're so ambitious, aren't you?

42
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:40,930
You know what you look like to me

43
00:02:41,014 --> 00:02:43,432
with your good bag and your cheap shoes?

44
00:02:43,517 --> 00:02:45,267
You look like a rube.

45
00:02:45,602 --> 00:02:49,730
A well-scrubbed, hustling rube
with a little taste.

46
00:02:50,565 --> 00:02:52,942
Good nutrition has given you
some length of bone,

47
00:02:53,026 --> 00:02:56,362
but you're not more than one generation
from poor white trash,

48
00:02:56,446 --> 00:02:58,364
are you, Agent Starling?

49
00:02:58,448 --> 00:03:01,283
And that accent you've tried
so desperately to shed,

50
00:03:01,326 --> 00:03:03,035
pure West Virginia.

51
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,913
What does your father do?
Is he a coal miner?

52
00:03:05,956 --> 00:03:07,998
Does he stink of the lamp?

53
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:10,709
And, oh, how quickly the boys found you.

54
00:03:10,794 --> 00:03:14,338
All those tedious, sticky fumblings
in the back seats of cars,

55
00:03:14,422 --> 00:03:18,175
while you could only dream
of getting out, getting anywhere,

56
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,971
getting all the way to the FBI.

57
00:03:25,267 --> 00:03:27,142
You see a lot, Doctor.

58
00:03:28,103 --> 00:03:33,023
But are you strong enough to point
that high-powered perception at yourself?

59
00:03:34,276 --> 00:03:35,568
What about it? Why don't you...

60
00:03:35,652 --> 00:03:39,238
Why don't you look at yourself
and write down what you see?

61
00:03:40,156 --> 00:03:41,907
Maybe you're afraid to.

62
00:03:51,501 --> 00:03:54,295
A census-taker once tried to test me.

63
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:58,048
I ate his liver with some fava beans,

64
00:03:58,133 --> 00:04:00,175
and a nice Chianti.

65
00:04:09,102 --> 00:04:11,895
You fly back to school now, little Starling.

66
00:04:12,522 --> 00:04:14,064
Fly, fly, fly.

67
00:04:29,122 --> 00:04:32,875
I bit my wrist so I could die.
