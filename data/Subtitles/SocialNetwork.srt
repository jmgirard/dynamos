1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
How do you distinguish yourself
in a population of people

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,960
who all got 1600 on their SATs?

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,840
- I didn't know they take SATs in China.
- They don't.

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,050
I wasn't talking about China anymore,
I was talking about me.

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,590
You got a 1600?

6
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,510
Yes. I could sing in an a Capella group,
but I can't sing.

7
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:12,800
Does that mean you actually
got nothing wrong?

8
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,180
I could row crew or invent a $25 PC.

9
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,510
Or you could get into a final club.

10
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,930
Or I get into a final club.

11
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,430
You know, from a woman's perspective,

12
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,390
sometimes not singing in
an a Capella group is a good thing.

13
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,520
This is serious.

14
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,060
On the other hand,
I do like guys who row crew.

15
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,020
Well, I can't do that.

16
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,690
I was kidding.

17
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,940
And, yes, I got nothing wrong on the test.

18
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,820
- Have you ever tried?
- I'm trying right now.

19
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,740
- To row crew?
- To get into a final club.

20
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,070
To row crew? No.
Are you, like, whatever, delusional?

21
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,120
Maybe it's just sometimes
you say two things at once.

22
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,740
I'm not sure which one
I'm supposed to be aiming at.

23
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,750
But you've seen guys who row crew, right?

24
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:41,870
No.

25
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,040
Okay, well, they're bigger than me.
They're world-class athletes.

26
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,580
And a second ago,
you said you like guys who row crew

27
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,710
so I assumed you had met one.

28
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,800
I guess I just meant I like the idea of it.
You know, the way a girl likes cowboys.

29
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,380
Okay.

30
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,930
Should we get something to eat?

31
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,800
Would you like to talk
about something else?

32
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,310
No. It's just since the beginning of
the conversation about finals club,

33
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,270
I think I may have missed a birthday.

34
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,230
There are really more people in China with
genius IQs than the entire population...

35
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,650
The Phoenix is the most diverse.
The Fly Club... Roosevelt punched the Porc.

36
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,820
Which one?

37
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,400
The Porcellian, the Porc.
It's the best of the best.

38
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,240
- Which Roosevelt?
- Theodore.

39
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,660
Is it true that they send a bus around
to pick up girls

40
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,200
who want to party with
the next Fed chairman?

41
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,990
So you can see why
it's so important to get in.

42
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,620
Okay, well, which is the easiest to get into?

43
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,000
- Why would you ask me that?
- I was just asking.

44
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,250
None of them. That's the point.

45
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,260
My friend Eduardo made $300,000
betting oil futures one summer

46
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,670
and Eduardo won't come close to getting in.

47
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,720
The ability to make money doesn't
impress anybody around here.

48
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,050
Must be nice.
He made $300,000 in a summer?

49
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,470
- He likes meteorology.
- You said it was oil futures.

50
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,770
You can read the weather,
you can predict the price of heating oil.

51
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:45,940
I think you asked me that

52
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,810
because you think
the final club that's easiest to get into

53
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,150
is the one where I'll have the best chance.

54
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,570
I... What?

55
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,190
You asked me which one was
the easiest to get into

56
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,780
because you think that that's the one
where I'll have the best chance.

57
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,360
The one that's the easiest to get into
would be the one

58
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,620
where anybody has the best chance.

59
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,280
You didn't ask me which one
was the best one,

60
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,830
you asked me which one
was the easiest one.

61
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,500
I was honestly just asking, okay?
I was just asking to ask.

62
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,960
- Mark, I'm not speaking in code.
- Erica.

63
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,380
You're obsessed with finals clubs.

64
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,840
You have finals clubs OCD
and you need to see someone about it

65
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,590
who will prescribe you
some sort of medication.

66
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,180
You don't care if the side effects
may include blindness.

67
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,970
Final clubs. Not "finals clubs."

68
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,770
And there's a difference between
being obsessed and being motivated.

69
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,690
Yes. There is.

70
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,440
Well, you do.
That was cryptic, so you do speak in code.

71
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,770
I didn't mean to be cryptic.

72
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,610
I'm just saying I need to do
something substantial

73
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,530
in order to get the attention of the clubs.

74
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,360
- Why?
- Because they're exclusive.

75
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,860
And fun, and they lead to a better life.

76
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,530
Teddy Roosevelt didn't get elected president

77
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,530
because he was a member
of the Phoenix Club.

78
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,870
He was a member of the Porcellian,
and yes, he did.

79
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,330
Well, why don't you just concentrate
on being the best you you can be?

80
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,960
Did you really just say that?

81
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,540
I was kidding.

82
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,290
Just because something's trite
doesn't make it less true.

83
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,460
I wanna try to be straightforward with you

84
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,800
and tell you I think you might
want to be a little more supportive.

85
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,470
If I get in, I will be taking you
to the events and the gatherings,

86
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,720
and you'll be meeting a lot of people
you wouldn't normally get to meet.

87
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,310
You would do that for me?

88
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,350
We're dating.

89
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,810
Okay.

90
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,060
Well, I wanna try and be
straightforward with you

91
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,980
and let you know that we're not anymore.

92
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,570
- What do you mean?
- We're not dating anymore. I'm sorry.

93
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,740
- Is this a joke?
- No, it's not.

94
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,820
You're breaking up with me?

95
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,160
You're gonna introduce me to people

96
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,910
I wouldn't normally
have the chance to meet?

97
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,830
What the... What is that supposed to mean?

98
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,160
- Wait, settle down.
- What is it supposed to mean?

99
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,080
Erica, the reason we're able to sit here
and drink right now

100
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,920
is 'cause you used to sleep
with the door guy.

101
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,670
"The door guy"? His name is Bobby.
I have not slept with the door guy.

102
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:40,170
The door guy is a friend of mine,
and he's a perfectly good class of people.

103
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,760
And what part of Long Island
are you from, Wimbledon?

104
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,100
- Wait. Wait, wait.
- I'm going back to my dorm.

105
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,510
- Is this real?
- Yes.

106
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
- Then wait, I apologize, okay?
- I have to go study.

107
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,020
- Erica?
- Yes?

108
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,350
- I'm sorry, I mean it.
- I appreciate that, but I have to go study.

109
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,690
Come on, you don't have to study.
Let's just talk.

110
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,020
- I can't.
- Why?

111
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,030
Because it is exhausting.
Dating you is like dating a StairMaster.

112
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,280
All I meant is that you're not likely to...
Currently...

113
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,530
I wasn't making a comment
on your appearance.

114
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,780
I was saying that you go to BU.
I was stating a fact, that's all,

115
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,950
and if it seemed rude, then I apologize.

116
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,370
- I have to go study.
- You don't have to study.

117
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,790
Why do you keep saying
I don't have to study?

118
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,710
'Cause you go to BU.

119
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,250
Do you want to get some food?

120
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,800
I am sorry you are not sufficiently
impressed with my education.

121
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,800
And I'm sorry I don't have a rowboat,
so we're even.

122
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,630
- I think we should just be friends.
- I don't want friends.

123
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,800
I was just being polite.

124
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,050
I have no intention
of being friends with you.

125
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,220
I'm under some pressure right now
from my OS class

126
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,890
and if we could just order some food,
I think we should...

127
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,650
Okay, you are probably going to be
a very successful computer person.

128
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,730
But you're gonna go through life
thinking that girls don't like you

129
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,480
because you're a nerd.

130
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,150
And I want you to know from the bottom
of my heart that that won't be true.

131
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,280
It'll be because you're an asshole.
