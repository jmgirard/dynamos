1
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,640
Watch your step.

2
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,710
Come in.

3
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,810
-Very nice house.
-Oh, thank you.

4
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,010
It's very rustic.

5
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,950
-Can I take your jacket?
-No, thank you, I'm fine.

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,320
Okay. This way, please.

7
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,930
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

8
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,830
-How about some tea?
-Oh, no, I'm all right.

9
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,460
-You sure?
-Yes.

10
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,800
I wanted to ask you about a film
that the Avenue may have played

11
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,630
while you were the organist there.

12
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,640
The Most Dangerous Game?

13
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,010
Oh, it's a classic. RKO. 1932.

14
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,440
Fay Wray, Joel McCrea, Leslie Banks.
We've run that picture many times.

15
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,250
In '68, '69?

16
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,380
I'd have to check my records. Why?

17
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,890
Do you remember the Zodiac?

18
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,990
This is about Rick Marshall, isn't it?

19
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,360
-He was a projectionist there, right?
-For a time, yes.

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,860
But I have no occasion
to correspond with him these days.

21
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,000
Okay. Well, there is a connection

22
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,570
between one of the Zodiac attacks
and that film.

23
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,440
You mean the symbol?

24
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,310
Hold on.

25
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:34,450
The Zodiac symbol on film.
It's on the countdown.

26
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,220
It's trimmed off each reel
before it's shown,

27
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,920
but it always arrives with it.

28
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,560
Right there.

29
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,370
The first time I saw it in the papers,
I thought about that.

30
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,830
We got a tip

31
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,730
that Rick left a film canister here
that he told you never to open.

32
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,040
A tip about a mysterious film canister?

33
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,770
Is it true?

34
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,010
Yes.

35
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,910
-Did you open it?
-No.

36
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:11,730
-May I see it?
-Rick took it back in 1972.

37
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,320
This tip is how you got it in your head
that Rick is the Zodiac?

38
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,060
That and the poster.

39
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,960
The poster?

40
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,230
The poster that Rick drew.

41
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,130
The handwriting is the closest
that we have ever come to a match.

42
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,440
-Rick didn't draw any posters.
-No, he drew this one.

43
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,380
Mr. Graysmith, I do the posters myself.

44
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,640
That's my handwriting.

45
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,750
I won't take any more of your time.

46
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,720
Why don't I just go and find out
when we played that film?

47
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,860
Oh, that's all right.

48
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,310
It's not a problem.
They're just down in the basement.

49
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,050
Not many people
have basements in California.

50
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,610
I do.

51
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,980
You coming, Mr. Graysmith?

52
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,970
The original studio one-sheets,
I always kept for myself.

53
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,730
The cheapo knock-offs
like you brought today

54
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,610
I end up tossing into the back alley.

55
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,980
'69.

56
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,620
You live alone?

57
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,530
Most Dangerous Game ran in May '69.

58
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,980
So, that would be about

59
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,180
nine weeks before
the first Zodiac letter, correct?

60
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,970
Yeah.

61
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,960
Do you think he saw the film
in our theater and was inspired?

62
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,940
Are you sure
there's nobody else in the house?

63
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,240
Would you like
to go upstairs and check?

64
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,830
No.

65
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,640
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

66
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,370
You're welcome.

67
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,130
It's locked.

68
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,370
Thank you.

69
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,950
Good night, Mr. Graysmith!
