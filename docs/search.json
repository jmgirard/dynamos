These continuous ratings were made on a single emotional valence scale ranging from -4 (very negative) to 4 (very positive).\n\nChromodoris Plot\nWe can plot the distribution of all valence ratings per second of the film clip to get a sense of how its emotional tone changes over time.

    "text": "Dynamic Ratings\nA total of 77 participants watched this film clip and used the CARMA software to provide continuous (i.e., second-by-second) ratings of how it made them feel. These continuous ratings were made on a single emotional valence scale ranging from -4 (very negative) to 4 (very positive).\n\nChromodoris Plot\nWe can plot the distribution of all valence ratings per second of the film clip to get a sense of how its emotional tone changes over time. The solid black line represents the mean of all ratings and the yellow, green, and purple ribbons represent the central 50%, 70%, and 90% of the ratings, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInter-Rater Reliability\nA Bayesian generalizability study was used to decompose the variance in ratings of this video clip into the following components: timepoint variance (in average ratings of each second, across raters), rater variance (in average ratings from each rater, across seconds), and residual variance (including second-by-rater interactions and measurement error). The lower and upper columns in the table below represent the boundaries of the 95% equal-tail credible interval. Note that we dropped the first 10 seconds of each clip (as rater “warmup” time).\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nTerm\nEstimate\nLower\nUpper\nPercent\n\n\n\n\nRater\nVariance\n1.319\n1.011\n1.938\n0.490\n\n\nTimepoint\nVariance\n0.253\n0.222\n0.296\n0.094\n\n\nResidual\nVariance\n1.118\n1.100\n1.135\n0.416\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom these variance components, we can estimate inter-rater reliability of the ratings. There are many formulations of the two-way intraclass correlation (ICC), but the most relevant to our purposes here are the balanced average-measures consistency formulation or ICC(C,k) and the balanced single-measures consistency formulation or ICC(C,1).\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm\nEstimate\nLower\nUpper\nRaters\nError\n\n\n\n\nICC(C,1)\n0.185\n0.166\n0.210\n1\nRelative\n\n\nICC(C,k)\n0.946\n0.939\n0.953\n77\nRelative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow, we can also visualize the posterior distributions of each of these parameters. Values with higher posterior density are more probable."

I was washing my hair.\n\n\n244.94\n246.510\n- (barks)\n\n\n246.66\n250.346\n- Where is she going with this? - Have a little faith, Gerard.\n\n\n258.82\n262.666\nMs. Windham, what had you done earlier that day?\n\n\n263.66\n266.106\nI got up, got a latte,\n\n\n266.26\n269.389\nwent to the gym, got a perm and came home.\n\n\n271.78\n273.987\nWhere you got in the shower?\n\n\n274.70\n278.864\nI believe the witness has made it clear that she was \"in the shower.\"\n\n\n279.02\n281.307\n(all chuckling)\n\n\n284.98\n286.789\nYes, Your Honor.\n\n\n286.94\n290.547\nMs. Windham, had you ever gotten a perm before?\n\n\n290.98\n293.950\n- Yes. - How many, would you say?\n\n\n295.06\n297.301\nTwo a year since I was 12.\n\n\n298.10\n299.511\nYou do the math.\n\n\n300.38\n303.509\nYou know, a girl in my sorority, Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once.\n\n\n303.70\n306.909\nWe all tried to talk her out of it.

Why is this relevant?\n\n\n320.10\n323.229\n- I have a point. I promise. - Then make it.\n\n\n324.02\n325.670\nYes, ma'am.\n\n\n326.42\n330.106\nChutney, why were Tracy Marcinko's curls ruined when she got hosed down?\n\n\n331.86\n333.749\n- Because they got wet. - Exactly.\n\n\n333.94\n336.511\nBecause isn't it the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance\n\n\n336.66\n338.867\nthat you're forbidden to wet your hair for at least 24 hours\n\n\n339.02\n340.988\nafter getting a perm at the risk of deactivating\n\n\n341.14\n345.270\n-the ammonium thioglycolate? - Yes...\n\n\n345.42\n348.549\nAnd wouldn't somebody who's had, say 30 perms before in their life\n\n\n348.70\n350.702\nbe well aware of this rule?\n\n\n350.86\n353.750\nAnd if you weren't washing your hair, as I suspect you weren't,\n\n\n353.90\n357.109\nbecause your curls are still intact, wouldn't you have heard the gunshot?\n\n\n357.26\n359.911\nAnd if, in fact, you had heard the gunshot, Brooke Windham\n\n\n360.06\n363.064\nwouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs,\n\n\n363.26\n365.945\nwhich would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham\n\n\n366.14\n369.622\nwith a gun in her hand to make your story plausible.

These continuous ratings were made on a single emotional valence scale ranging from -4 (very negative) to 4 (very positive).\n\nChromodoris Plot\nWe can plot the distribution of all valence ratings per second of the film clip to get a sense of how its emotional tone changes over time. The solid black line represents the mean of all ratings and the yellow, green, and purple ribbons represent the central 50%, 70%, and 90% of the ratings, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInter-Rater Reliability\nA Bayesian generalizability study was used to decompose the variance in ratings of this video clip into the following components: timepoint variance (in average ratings of each second, across raters), rater variance (in average ratings from each rater, across seconds), and residual variance (including second-by-rater interactions and measurement error). The lower and upper columns in the table below represent the boundaries of the 95% equal-tail credible interval. Note that we dropped the first 10 seconds of each clip (as rater “warmup” time).\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nTerm\nEstimate\nLower\nUpper\nPercent\n\n\n\n\nRater\nVariance\n0.676\n0.516\n0.983\n0.462\n\n\nTimepoint\nVariance\n0.226\n0.189\n0.280\n0.155\n\n\nResidual\nVariance\n0.560\n0.548\n0.573\n0.383\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom these variance components, we can estimate inter-rater reliability of the ratings. There are many formulations of the two-way intraclass correlation (ICC), but the most relevant to our purposes here are the balanced average-measures consistency formulation or ICC(C,k) and the balanced single-measures consistency formulation or ICC(C,1).\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm\nEstimate\nLower\nUpper\nRaters\nError\n\n\n\n\nICC(C,1)\n0.291\n0.252\n0.333\n1\nRelative\n\n\nICC(C,k)\n0.969\n0.962\n0.974\n75\nRelative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow, we can also visualize the posterior distributions of each of these parameters.

She's a publicist from San Francisco.\n\n\n370.394\n372.386\nYour father hired her at the beginning of the summer\n\n\n372.562\n374.428\nto do some publicity for the vineyard.\n\n\n374.606\n378.646\nIf you ask me, she's doing a better job of selling herself than the grapes.\n\n\n378.819\n382.028\nWhat do you mean?\n\n\n383.573\n386.907\nLook, you and I both know your father's not some kind of suave, debonair,\n\n\n387.077\n388.409\nbachelor-of-the-month type.\n\n\n388.578\n392.037\nSo I gotta ask myself, what does a hot young thing like that\n\n\n392.207\n394.915\nsee in a guy who walks around with his shirttail hanging out\n\n\n395.085\n396.576\nand a cereal bowl full of chili.\n\n\n397.337\n401.547\nThen I realized there's about a million reasons why that girl's giggling.\n\n\n403.510\n406.378\nAll of them are sitting at the Napa Valley Community Bank.\n\n\n406.596\n409.054\nYou mean, you don't think she even really likes him?\n\n\n409.224\n411.307\nAh, what do I know? But I tell you one thing,\n\n\n411.476\n413.968\nthis one's got your father eating out of the palm of her hand.\n\n\n414.187\n417.897\nThey do everything together. They ride together, they swim together.\n\n\n418.066\n420.058\nThey go out to eat dinner every night.\n\n\n420.235\n424.400\nDo you know what? Meet her. See for yourself. Don't let me influence you."

What?\n\n\n111.65\n113.19\nYou asked me which one was the easiest to get into\n\n\n113.28\n115.78\nbecause you think that that's the one where I'll have the best chance.\n\n\n115.86\n118.36\nThe one that's the easiest to get into would be the one\n\n\n118.45\n119.62\nwhere anybody has the best chance.\n\n\n119.70\n121.28\nYou didn't ask me which one was the best one,\n\n\n121.37\n122.83\nyou asked me which one was the easiest one.\n\n\n123.08\n126.50\nI was honestly just asking, okay?

    "text": "Dynamic Ratings\nA total of 73 participants watched this film clip and used the CARMA software to provide continuous (i.e., second-by-second) ratings of how it made them feel. These continuous ratings were made on a single emotional valence scale ranging from -4 (very negative) to 4 (very positive).\n\nChromodoris Plot\nWe can plot the distribution of all valence ratings per second of the film clip to get a sense of how its emotional tone changes over time. The solid black line represents the mean of all ratings and the yellow, green, and purple ribbons represent the central 50%, 70%, and 90% of the ratings, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInter-Rater Reliability\nA Bayesian generalizability study was used to decompose the variance in ratings of this video clip into the following components: timepoint variance (in average ratings of each second, across raters), rater variance (in average ratings from each rater, across seconds), and residual variance (including second-by-rater interactions and measurement error). The lower and upper columns in the table below represent the boundaries of the 95% equal-tail credible interval. Note that we dropped the first 10 seconds of each clip (as rater “warmup” time).\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nTerm\nEstimate\nLower\nUpper\nPercent\n\n\n\n\nRater\nVariance\n1.190\n0.926\n1.812\n0.407\n\n\nTimepoint\nVariance\n0.244\n0.206\n0.294\n0.083\n\n\nResidual\nVariance\n1.491\n1.461\n1.519\n0.510\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom these variance components, we can estimate inter-rater reliability of the ratings. There are many formulations of the two-way intraclass correlation (ICC), but the most relevant to our purposes here are the balanced average-measures consistency formulation or ICC(C,k) and the balanced single-measures consistency formulation or ICC(C,1).\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm\nEstimate\nLower\nUpper\nRaters\nError\n\n\n\n\nICC(C,1)\n0.140\n0.121\n0.165\n1\nRelative\n\n\nICC(C,k)\n0.923\n0.910\n0.935\n73\nRelative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow, we can also visualize the posterior distributions of each of these parameters. Values with higher posterior density are more probable."
