This is the webpage for the DynAMoS database, which is a curated collection of affective movie clips, metadata about those movie clips, and ratings of the emotional content of those movie clips from a large group of anonymous research participants. Within this webpage, you can find information about the database as a whole, about each movie clip in the database, and about the database collection methodology. You can also request access to the database by signing a licensing agreement (coming soon).

The DynAMoS project is a collaboration between the following researchers at the University of Kansas, McLean Hospital, and Brigam and Women's Hospital. This website is maintained by Dr. Girard.
